A solution would improve waste processing efficiency and reduce landfill dependency.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Outcomes</b><br><br>\n• IoT-based system or mobile app to monitor segregation at collection points.<br>\n• Provide real-time feedback to households on compliance.<br>\n• Generate compliance reports for local authorities to enforce better waste management.<br><br>\n\n<b>Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries</b><br><br>\n• Urban local bodies<br>\n• Residents<br>\n• Waste management agencies<br>\n• Environmental organizations<br><br>\n\n<b>Supporting Data</b><br><br>\nSwachh Bharat Mission Urban 2.0 Report, highlighting segregation challenges.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of Punjab </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Department of Higher Education \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Such a system should be user-friendly, reliable, and work seamlessly in both in-person and online settings.<br><br>\n\n<b>Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved</b><br><br>\n• Saves valuable teaching time otherwise wasted on manual attendance.<br>\n• Reduces errors and eliminates the problem of proxy attendance.<br>\n• Provides actionable insights for faculty to identify disengaged or struggling students.<br>\n• Enhances transparency and accountability in academic processes.<br>\n• Supports digital transformation of higher education institutions.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Outcomes</b><br><br>\n• Automated attendance system using QR codes, biometrics, or facial recognition.<br>\n• Cloud-based dashboard for administrators and faculty to review attendance records.<br>\n• Analytics to identify attendance trends and student engagement levels.<br>\n• Compatibility with both offline and online classes.<br><br>\n\n<b>Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries</b><br><br>\n• Students<br>\n• Faculty and academic administrators<br>\n• College management bodies<br>\n• Education departments and policymakers</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of Punjab </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Department of Higher Education \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Education</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Laser-based QR codes are already prevalent in other industries.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Solution</b><br><br>\nInnovative solutions are invited through Smart India Hackathon 2025 to develop and implement a system addressing identification of bulk supply materials, their performance issues, and effective inventory management and quality monitoring actions for safety performance of fittings.<br><br>\n\n• <b>Hardware Solution:</b> Design and implement laser-based QR code imprints on bulk supply items of track fittings and sleepers.<br>\n• <b>Software Solution:</b> Develop QR code linkage and integrate with the UDM and TMS portals; enable mobile scans to generate AI-based reports related to vendor, supply, warranty, inspections, and support inventory management, etc.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Railways </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Ministry of Railways \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Transportation &amp; Logistics</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Central to this transformation are two key coding systems: the National AYUSH Morbidity &amp; Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMASTE) codes, which provide over 4,500 standardized terms for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani disorders, WHO Standardised International Terminologies for Ayurveda and the WHO’s ICD-11, Chapter – 26, Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2), which integrates 529 disorder categories and 196 pattern codes into the global ICD framework. Harmonising these vocabularies within Electronic Medical Record (EMR) platforms not only enables accurate clinical documentation and decision support but also ensures compliance with India’s 2016 EHR Standards—mandating FHIR R4 APIs, SNOMED CT and LOINC semantics, ISO 22600 access control, ABHA-linked OAuth 2.0 authentication, and robust audit trails for consent and versioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nTo operationalize this dual-coding approach, EMR vendors must implement a lightweight terminology micro-service that ingests NAMASTE CSV and synchronises with the WHO-11 ICD-API (Including Biomedicine and TM2). Within the EMR user interface, diagnosis entries should support auto-complete widgets that return both NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) codes, comply with the Coding rules of ICD-11 framework and store them together in the patient’s Problem List resource. This integration empowers clinicians to combine traditional and biomedical insights, facilitates Ayush insurance claims under global ICD-11 coding rules, and provides the Ministry of Ayush with real-time morbidity analytics aligned with national and international reporting standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDesign and prototype an API integration that brings India’s NAMASTE terminologies, WHO Standardised International terminology and the WHO ICD-11 (Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) &amp;amp; Biomedicine) into a FHIR-compliant Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system.

Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nA blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb&#039;s journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., &quot;CollectionEvent,&quot; &quot;QualityTest,&quot; &quot;ProcessingStep&quot;) and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nA permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb&#039;s journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a &quot;Collection Event.&quot; Subsequent &quot;Processing Step&quot; and &quot;Quality Test&quot; events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWhen formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Expected Solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nParticipants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs.

Cases of fraudulent documents being used for jobs, admissions, or government schemes have highlighted the absence of a robust mechanism to verify the authenticity of educational credentials issued by colleges and universities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAt present, verification is often manual, relying on physical inspection, emails to institutions, or outdated databases. This creates delays, inconsistency, and susceptibility to corruption or manipulation. To preserve academic integrity and public trust, there is a pressing need for an efficient, secure, and scalable digital system to detect and prevent the use of fake degrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe challenge is to create a digital platform that can authenticate and detect fake degrees or certificates issued by higher education institutions across Jharkhand.

Cases of fraudulent documents being used for jobs, admissions, or government schemes have highlighted the absence of a robust mechanism to verify the authenticity of educational credentials issued by colleges and universities.<br><br>\nAt present, verification is often manual, relying on physical inspection, emails to institutions, or outdated databases. This creates delays, inconsistency, and susceptibility to corruption or manipulation. To preserve academic integrity and public trust, there is a pressing need for an efficient, secure, and scalable digital system to detect and prevent the use of fake degrees.<br><br>\n\n<b>Detailed Description</b><br><br>\nThe challenge is to create a digital platform that can authenticate and detect fake degrees or certificates issued by higher education institutions across Jharkhand.

While citizens may encounter these issues daily, a lack of effective reporting and tracking mechanisms limits municipal responsiveness. A streamlined, mobile-first solution can bridge this gap by empowering community members to submit real-world reports that municipalities can systematically address.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe system revolves around an easy-to-use mobile interface that allows users to submit reports in real-time. Each report can contain a photo, automatic location tagging, and a short text or voice explanation, providing sufficient context. These submissions populate a centralized dashboard featuring a live, interactive map of the city&#039;s reported issues.

While citizens may encounter these issues daily, a lack of effective reporting and tracking mechanisms limits municipal responsiveness. A streamlined, mobile-first solution can bridge this gap by empowering community members to submit real-world reports that municipalities can systematically address.<br><br>\n\n<b>Detailed Description</b><br><br>\nThe system revolves around an easy-to-use mobile interface that allows users to submit reports in real-time. Each report can contain a photo, automatic location tagging, and a short text or voice explanation, providing sufficient context. These submissions populate a centralized dashboard featuring a live, interactive map of the city's reported issues.

Additionally, valuable insights from public discussions on social media during hazard events remain untapped, yet can be critical for understanding ground realities, public awareness, and the spread of information.<br><br>\n\n<b>Detailed Description</b><br><br>\nThere is a need for a unified platform that enables citizens, coastal residents, volunteers, and disaster managers to report observations during hazardous ocean events (e.g., unusual tides, flooding, coastal damage, tsunami, swell surges, high waves, etc.) and to monitor public communication trends via social media.<br><br>\n\nThis platform should:<br>\n• Allow citizens to submit geotagged reports, photos, or videos of observed ocean hazards via a mobile/web app.<br>\n• Support role-based access for citizens, officials, and analysts.<br>\n• Aggregate and visualize real-time crowdsourced data on a dynamic dashboard.<br>\n• Visualize all crowdsourced reports and social media indicators on an interactive map, with hotspots dynamically generated based on report density, keyword frequency, or verified incidents.<br>\n• Integrate social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, public Facebook posts, YouTube comments) and apply Text Classification/Natural Language Processing to extract hazard-related discussions and trends.<br>\n• Help emergency response agencies understand the scale, urgency, and sentiment of hazard events.<br>\n• Provide filters by location, event type, date, and source, enabling better situational awareness and faster validation of warning models.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Solution</b><br><br>\nAn integrated software platform (mobile + web) with:<br>\n• User registration and reporting interface with media upload.<br>\n• Map-based dashboard showing live crowd reports and social media activity.<br>\n• Dynamic hotspot generation based on report volume or verified threat indicators.<br>\n• Backend database and API for data management and integration with early warning systems.<br>\n• NLP engine for detecting relevant hazard-related posts, keywords, and engagement metrics.<br>\n• Multilingual support for regional accessibility.<br>\n• Offline data collection capabilities (sync later), useful for remote coastal areas.<br></div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Disaster Management</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.<br></div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/<br>\n                                     <a href=\"https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/\">https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/<br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/\">https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/<br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                                            <a href=\"https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                                        https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/                                                    </a><br>\n                                                                                    </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways.

The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 &quot;Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method&quot; prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nFurther, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 &quot;Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test&quot;. This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery.

Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills.

Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management.<br><br>\n\n<b>Description</b><br><br>\nOverview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills.

Many existing solutions identified so far are not cost-effective or viable for the vast distribution network.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Solution</b><br><br>\nAn innovative solution based on IoT and AI, including edge intelligence, may provide an economical and scalable solution for this socially relevant problem faced by KSEBL.<br></div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of Kerala </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Kerala State Electricity Board Limited (KSEBL) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Disaster Management</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

By informing decisions on product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recovery, LCA enables a shift toward a <b>circular economy</b> where materials are kept in use longer and waste is minimized.<br><br>\n\n<b>Problem Statement</b><br><br>\nThere is a need to design an <b>intuitive, AI-powered software platform</b> that enables metallurgists, engineers, and decision-makers to perform automated LCAs for metals such as aluminium, copper, or critical minerals, with a special emphasis on <b>circularity</b>.<br><br>\n\n<b>Proposed Solution</b><br>\nThe platform should:<br>\n- Allow users to input or select process and production details (including raw vs. recycled routes, energy use, transport, and end-of-life options).<br>\n- Use AI/ML models to estimate missing parameters and predict both environmental and circularity indicators (e.g., recycled content, resource efficiency, extended product life, potential for reuse).<br>\n- Visualize circular flow opportunities alongside environmental impacts across the full value chain — from raw material extraction through reuse or recycling.<br>\n- Enable easy comparison of conventional and circular processing pathways.<br>\n- Generate actionable reports and recommendations for reducing impacts and enhancing circularity, even when users have limited data or specialized expertise.<br><br>\n\n<b>Impact</b><br><br>\nWith this tool, the metals sector will be empowered to make practical, data-driven choices that foster environmental sustainability while advancing circular, resource-efficient systems.<br></div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Mines </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Jawaharlal Nehru Aluminium Research Development and Design Centre (JNARDDC) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The system should process <b>multi-source data inputs</b> including:<br>\n- Digital Elevation Models (DEM)<br>\n- Drone-captured imagery<br>\n- Geotechnical sensor data (displacement, strain, pore pressure)<br>\n- Environmental factors (rainfall, temperature, vibrations)<br><br>\n\nMachine learning models should identify <b>patterns that precede rockfall events</b>. The system must feature a <b>user-friendly dashboard</b> for mine planners, along with:<br>\n- Real-time risk maps<br>\n- Probability-based forecasts<br>\n- Alert mechanisms (via SMS/email)<br>\nIntegration with <b>low-cost monitoring hardware</b> would be an added advantage.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Solution</b><br><br>\n- A machine learning model trained on real or synthetic data to predict rockfall risks.<br>\n- A web/mobile-based dashboard for visualization of vulnerable zones.<br>\n- Real-time alert generation with suggested action plans.<br>\n- Open-source integration possibilities for scale and customization.<br><br>\n\n<b>Impact</b><br><br>\nThe solution should be <b>cost-effective</b>, <b>scalable</b> for different mine sites, and adaptable for both <b>public and private mining operations</b>, enabling safer and more resilient mining practices.<br></div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Mines </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                National Institute of Rock Mechanics (NIRM) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Disaster Management</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Aspiring athletes, particularly from rural and remote areas, often lack access to standardized assessment facilities or opportunities to showcase their talent. The absence of reliable and scalable talent assessment models hinders the discovery of potential athletes who could benefit from Government support. A set of standard fitness assessment tests - including height, weight, vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, and endurance runs (Annexure A) - provides a scientific method to evaluate talent. However, the reach and implementation of such tests remain limited due to infrastructure constraints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Problem Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Sports Authority of India (SAI) requires an innovative, mobile-based solution to democratize sports talent assessment. The proposed platform should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n1. Enable athletes to download an app and record videos of their performance in the prescribed fitness assessment tests.&lt;br&gt;\n2. Use AI/ML-based on-device verification to analyze the recorded videos for accuracy and authenticity (e.g., detecting jump height, counting sit-ups, or measuring time/distance in runs).&lt;br&gt;\n3. Securely submit verified data to SAI servers for further evaluation and athlete profiling.&lt;br&gt;\n4. Be low-cost and lightweight, ensuring accessibility even on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Innovative Features&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n1. AI-based Cheat Detection: Identify anomalies or manipulations (e.g., tampered videos or incorrect movements) to ensure fair assessments.&lt;br&gt;\n2. Offline Video Analysis: Perform preliminary performance analysis directly on the device without requiring continuous internet connectivity.&lt;br&gt;\n3.

Aspiring athletes, particularly from rural and remote areas, often lack access to standardized assessment facilities or opportunities to showcase their talent. The absence of reliable and scalable talent assessment models hinders the discovery of potential athletes who could benefit from Government support. A set of standard fitness assessment tests - including height, weight, vertical jump, shuttle run, sit-ups, and endurance runs (Annexure A) - provides a scientific method to evaluate talent. However, the reach and implementation of such tests remain limited due to infrastructure constraints.<br><br>\n\n<b>Problem Description</b><br><br>\nThe Sports Authority of India (SAI) requires an innovative, mobile-based solution to democratize sports talent assessment. The proposed platform should:<br><br>\n1. Enable athletes to download an app and record videos of their performance in the prescribed fitness assessment tests.<br>\n2. Use AI/ML-based on-device verification to analyze the recorded videos for accuracy and authenticity (e.g., detecting jump height, counting sit-ups, or measuring time/distance in runs).<br>\n3. Securely submit verified data to SAI servers for further evaluation and athlete profiling.<br>\n4. Be low-cost and lightweight, ensuring accessibility even on entry-level smartphones and low-bandwidth networks.<br><br>\n\n<b>Innovative Features</b><br><br>\n1. AI-based Cheat Detection: Identify anomalies or manipulations (e.g., tampered videos or incorrect movements) to ensure fair assessments.<br>\n2. Offline Video Analysis: Perform preliminary performance analysis directly on the device without requiring continuous internet connectivity.<br>\n3. Performance Benchmarking: Compare athlete performance against age/gender-based benchmarks, providing instant feedback.<br>\n4. Gamified User Interface: Use progress badges, leaderboards, and interactive visuals to engage athletes and encourage participation.<br>\n5. Auto-Test Segmentation: Automatically detect and segment performance clips (e.g., counting reps in sit-ups or analyzing vertical jumps) to reduce manual effort.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Deliverables</b><br><br>\n1. A mobile application (Android/iOS) that allows video recording and assessment of athletes performance across the test batteries.<br>\n2. AI/ML modules for on-device video analysis, verification of test results, and cheat detection.<br>\n3. A secure backend system to transmit data to the Sports Authority of India for further processing.<br>\n4. A dashboard for officials to view and evaluate verified performance data.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Impact</b><br><br>\n1. Democratization of sports talent assessment, reaching even remote areas.<br>\n2. Low-cost, scalable solution enabling mass participation in talent identification initiatives.<br>\n3.

Every business day the organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links—often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax: \n● Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations. \n● Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening.\n● Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing &amp; Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities. \n● Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them. \n● Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches. \n\nAs KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder—from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors—with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source. Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL’s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi.</div> -->\n                                 <div class=\"style-2\" style=\"overflow-y: auto; min-height:20px; max-height: 200px; width:100%;\"> Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise that stretches far beyond train operations.

Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL’s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of Kerala </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide.\nDescription:\nThe challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed  high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses.

Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide.\nDescription:\nThe challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed  high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses.

Expected Solution:\nTeams should outline an integrated workflow in which admission data flows seamlessly into a central student database, financial transactions automatically generate digital receipts, hostel and library records update the same database in real time, and summary dashboards present key metrics to administrators all delivered through interlinked, widely available software services rather than proprietary or hardware-intensive solutions.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of Rajasthan </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Separate pilot installations-rooftop photovoltaic panels on one block, a small wind turbine near another-have demonstrated value in isolation, yet they operate independently, lack coordinated scheduling, and cannot guarantee stable power when weather fluctuates. As tariff subsidies taper and carbon-reduction mandates tighten, institutes must find practical ways to maximise on-site renewable generation while preserving supply reliability for critical labs and hostels.\n\nDescription:\nThe crux of the challenge is orchestration, not hardware procurement. When the sun is at its peak, excess photovoltaic output sometimes exceeds immediate demand, while during cloudy afternoons or still evenings the turbine may produce little, forcing the campus to revert entirely to grid draw. Batteries, if present at all, are under-utilised because charge-discharge cycles are triggered by fixed rules rather than data-driven forecasts. Separate inverters, meters, and legacy control boxes provide fragmented read-outs that facilities staff inspect manually, often hours after the relevant events. Without a holistic view, administrators cannot determine when to schedule energy-intensive workshops, how to stagger HVAC loads, or whether to export surplus to the utility. Furthermore, campus management lacks clear evidence to justify additional renewable investments or to report carbon savings credibly. A modern, software-centric coordination layer is therefore needed to treat solar, wind, battery storage, and grid import as a single virtual power plant. Such a platform would ingest real-time sensor streams, fuse them with short-term weather forecasts, predict generation and demand curves; and recommend charge, discharge, or curtailment actions that minimise cost, and emissions. Crucially, the solution must remain usable by non-specialist technicians: dashboards must highlight actionable insights rather than raw kilowatt data; alert thresholds should be adjustable through simple menus; and historical analytics must export seamlessly for statutory reporting Because pilot hardware configurations vary widely from campus to campus, the orchestration software must stay agnostic to specific panel brands, turbine controllers, or battery chemistries, relying instead on open data interfaces or  easily scripted adapters. By focusing on an interoperable, software-only intelligence layer, the hackathon team sidesteps heavy capital expenditure while unlocking the full potential of hardware assets the institution already owns. A successful proof-of-concept will demonstrate that thoughtful data modelling and optimisation can boost renewable utilisation, shrink electricity bills, and provide a replicable blueprint for other government campuses.\n\nExpected Solution:\nParticipants should outline a comprehensive, vendor-neutral software framework that continuously integrates live generation and consumption data, applies predictive analytics to forecast both supply and dermand, and issues real-time operational recommendations such as optimal battery charging windows or load-shifting opportunities to maximise self-consumption of solar-wind energy, reduce grid dependence, and facilitate transparent reporting of carbon savings, while remaining simple enough for facilities staff to adopt without specialised training or additional hardware expenditure.</div> -->\n                                 <div class=\"style-2\" style=\"overflow-y: auto; min-height:20px; max-height: 200px; width:100%;\"> Background:\nMany public-sector campuses across Rajasthan consume substantial grid electricity even though solar irradiance and wind potential are favourable throughout most of the year.

A successful proof-of-concept will demonstrate that thoughtful data modelling and optimisation can boost renewable utilisation, shrink electricity bills, and provide a replicable blueprint for other government campuses.\n\nExpected Solution:\nParticipants should outline a comprehensive, vendor-neutral software framework that continuously integrates live generation and consumption data, applies predictive analytics to forecast both supply and dermand, and issues real-time operational recommendations such as optimal battery charging windows or load-shifting opportunities to maximise self-consumption of solar-wind energy, reduce grid dependence, and facilitate transparent reporting of carbon savings, while remaining simple enough for facilities staff to adopt without specialised training or additional hardware expenditure.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of Rajasthan </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Although the initial project successfully demonstrated a foldable stainless-steel crutch, the heavier weight limited its suitability for elderly and long-term users. Emerging technologies in lightweight materials, IoT-enabled healthcare, and smart rehabilitation devices offer an opportunity to reimagine the design of crutches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nBy switching to aluminium alloys, the device can be made lighter without compromising durability. Further, by embedding sensors, shock-absorbing dampers, reflective safety features, and IoT connectivity, the crutch can evolve from a mechanical support into a smart rehabilitation companion that enhances safety, comfort, and clinical monitoring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis project proposes the development of a next-generation foldable axillary crutch using lightweight aluminium alloy as the primary structural material. Aluminium will significantly reduce the overall weight of the crutch, improving usability for elderly and frail patients while maintaining adequate load-bearing capacity. The foldable design, refined from the stainless-steel prototype, will retain its compactness and ergonomic efficiency, making it highly portable for users who travel or live in compact environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nTo address the issue of upper-limb strain, the new design will incorporate shock-absorbing dampers at the base of the shaft, reducing impact forces transmitted to the shoulders and wrists. Ergonomic improvements such as anatomically contoured handgrips, adjustable padding, and modular replaceable parts will ensure sustained comfort and adaptability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe innovation lies in the integration of IoT and sensor-based technologies.

Although the initial project successfully demonstrated a foldable stainless-steel crutch, the heavier weight limited its suitability for elderly and long-term users. Emerging technologies in lightweight materials, IoT-enabled healthcare, and smart rehabilitation devices offer an opportunity to reimagine the design of crutches.<br><br>\n\nBy switching to aluminium alloys, the device can be made lighter without compromising durability. Further, by embedding sensors, shock-absorbing dampers, reflective safety features, and IoT connectivity, the crutch can evolve from a mechanical support into a smart rehabilitation companion that enhances safety, comfort, and clinical monitoring.<br><br>\n\n<b>Description</b><br><br>\nThis project proposes the development of a next-generation foldable axillary crutch using lightweight aluminium alloy as the primary structural material. Aluminium will significantly reduce the overall weight of the crutch, improving usability for elderly and frail patients while maintaining adequate load-bearing capacity. The foldable design, refined from the stainless-steel prototype, will retain its compactness and ergonomic efficiency, making it highly portable for users who travel or live in compact environments.<br><br>\n\nTo address the issue of upper-limb strain, the new design will incorporate shock-absorbing dampers at the base of the shaft, reducing impact forces transmitted to the shoulders and wrists. Ergonomic improvements such as anatomically contoured handgrips, adjustable padding, and modular replaceable parts will ensure sustained comfort and adaptability.<br><br>\n\nThe innovation lies in the integration of IoT and sensor-based technologies. Embedded force and motion sensors will monitor weight distribution, gait pattern, and posture. Data will be transmitted wirelessly to a mobile application, where users and clinicians can track mobility progress, receive real-time feedback, and identify risks of incorrect usage.

The device is powered by an external 5V power bank and utilizes a servo motor for mechanical actuation.<br>\nAt the core of the system is an ESP32 microprocessor, which controls the servo motor based on input from a 3-way switch. The switch enables intuitive control through three discrete positions:<br>\nPosition \"0\" – Neutral/rest position<br>\nPosition \"1\" – Initiates wrist-hand flexion and grasping<br>\nPosition \"11\" – Triggers release of the grasp<br>\nThe orthosis implements a 3-jaw chuck prehension pattern<br><br>\n\n<b>Expected Solution</b><br><br>\nA low-cost, wearable orthotic device that restores partial wrist-hand function.<br>\nSwitch-based control for intuitive operation, especially for patients with limited dexterity.<br>\nImproved independence in ADLs (activities of daily living).<br>\nPortable and easy to maintain.<br>\nIt offers reliable control and mimics natural hand motion through 3-jaw chuck prehension<br>\nIt majorly supporting rehabilitation program for upper limb weakness patient</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment(MoSJE) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya National Institute for Persons with Physical Disabilities(Divyangjan)(PDUNIPPD), An Autonomous body under Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DoEPwd) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Enables a prototype Direct Digital Lending Module that can approve loans digitally for low-risk, eligible beneficiaries.<br><br>\n\n<b>Constraints</b><br><br>\n• Model must work even with incomplete historical or consumption data (handle missing values).<br>\n• Scoring methodology must be transparent and explainable for compliance and audit.<br>\n• Must classify beneficiaries into Risk Bands (e.g., Low Risk–High Need, Low Risk–Low Need, High Risk–High Need, etc.).<br>\n• Should allow periodic re-scoring as new repayment or consumption data is added.<br><br>\n\n<b>Deliverables</b><br><br>\n• Working ML model that outputs composite scores.<br>\n• Dashboard or API to view beneficiary scores and risk bands.<br><br>\n\n<b>Impact Goal</b><br><br>\n• Ensure loans reach genuine, low-income beneficiaries with good repayment behaviour.<br>\n• Reduce processing time for repeat borrowers by 50% or more.<br>\n• Enable same-day sanction for high-score beneficiaries through direct digital lending.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment(MoSJE) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Samajik Nyay Aur Shashaktikaran Vibhag \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The challenge is to develop software that will generate the dimensions of these instruments for any latitude and longitude in India.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>AICTE </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Heritage &amp; Culture</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The challenge is to develop a program that correctly identifies the chandas of any given Shloka.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>AICTE </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Education</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Currently, most anti-drone strategies rely on traditional Air Defence systems or Electronic Warfare techniques such as jamming. However, these methods may be limited in effectiveness, scalability, or cost. An alternative is to use autonomous drone swarms to counter adversarial drone swarms, leveraging decentralized coordination, adaptive behaviour, and real-time decision-making to neutralize threats more efficiently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nTo develop an effective solution for autonomous swarm-based drone counter engagement, the following assumptions and requirements must be considered:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n1. Armament Capability: Each drone is with armament capability. It is to be assumed that the adversary&#039;s drones are also similarly armed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n2. Environmental Perception: Drones must be equipped with appropriate sensors (e.g., Radar, LiDAR, Vision systems) to detect and track other drones within their operational vicinity. Additionally, drones should be able to classify targets as friendly or hostile based on sensor inputs and identification protocols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n3. Swarm Coordination Algorithm: A robust and efficient algorithm is required to coordinate the swarm in real time. This algorithm should enable autonomous drones to collaboratively execute efficient manoeuvres for engaging hostile drones and optimise the overall effectiveness of the swarm in tackling threat from hostile drones. Effectiveness means protecting ground assets and minimizing loss of friendly drones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe primary objective of this problem is to develop a decentralized swarm manoeuvre algorithm for autonomous drones operating in a protective role. The algorithm should enable drones to collectively execute swarming manoeuvres—swarming means quickly bringing more forces together against a smaller enemy to gain an advantage, while staying away from battles where the enemy has more troops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe protective drone swarm&#039;s mission is to protect designated ground assets from hostile drone swarms. Therefore, the algorithm must ensure that no enemy drone with ground attack capabilities* is left unattended** if it is within a threatening range*** of any friendly asset. Prioritization and dynamic threat assessment are critical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nGiven the inherent complexity and scalability challenges of centralized control, the swarm must operate in a distributed and autonomous manner. The algorithm is to be embedded in each drone individually, enabling local decision-making without reliance on a central controller. While it may be assumed that drones possess inter-drone and drone-to-ground communication capabilities, the algorithm must be designed to function effectively even in the complete absence of communication. Communication, if available, may be used to enhance performance but should not be a dependency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;Expected Solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe expected outcome is a swarm control algorithm that enables friendly autonomous drones to collaboratively engage and neutralize an adversarial drone swarm using effective swarming manoeuvre. The algorithm must prioritize the protection of designated ground assets, ensuring that no enemy drone capable of attacking ground targets is left unattended within a threatening range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe solution should be decentralized in nature, allowing each drone to operate autonomously based on its local perception and on-board intelligence. While limited communication between drones and with the ground station can be assumed to be available, the algorithm must not be dependent on continuous communication for core functionality. It should demonstrate robust and satisfactory performance even in communication-denied or degraded environments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nTo validate the solution’s effectiveness, a stochastic simulation framework must be implemented to evaluate the algorithm through executions across a diverse set of scenarios and each scenario being executed multiple times.

Low productivity is often caused by traditional farming practices, inadequate access to real-time data, poor irrigation management, lack of precision in use of pesticide and/or fertilizer and delayed identification of pests and diseases.

However, real-world applications often require reasoning across multiple modalities, particularly the ability to interpret and generate responses grounded in visual input. On 5th August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS (20b and 120b) open-weight models with state-of-the-art real-world performance at low cost.

The solution should:<br><ol><li>Align optical and thermal data accurately, ensuring geometric co-registration between multi-sensor imagery.</li><li>Leverage optical features (edges, land cover boundaries, textures) to guide the super-resolution process.</li><li>Preserve thermal fidelity by maintaining physically consistent surface temperatures and avoiding transfer of false textures.</li><li>Incorporate physics-based priors or models (e.g., radiative transfer, emissivity correction, or energy balance principles) to strengthen the reliability of outputs, especially in regions where optical data may be misleading.</li><li>Generate high-resolution thermal IR maps that are both physically meaningful and suitable for real-world applications such as urban planning, wildfire monitoring, and precision agriculture.</li><li>Ensure the solution is computationally efficient and scalable for processing large-area satellite imagery.</li></ol><br><b>Evaluation</b><br>Solutions will be evaluated based on:<br><ul><li><b>Quantitative Metrics:</b><br>○ PSNR, SSIM, and RMSE (Kelvin) against reference thermal images.</li><li><b>Qualitative Metrics:</b><br>○ Edge sharpness, alignment accuracy, and fusion realism (avoiding optical artifacts).</li></ul></div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Department of Space(DoS) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Space Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    https://www.sac.gov.in/sih2025<br>\n                                     <a href=\"https://www.sac.gov.in/sih2025\">https://www.sac.gov.in/sih2025<br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/https://www.sac.gov.in/sih2025\">https://www.sac.gov.in/sih2025<br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                                            <a href=\"https://www.sac.gov.in/sih2025\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                                        https://www.sac.gov.in/sih2025                                                    </a><br>\n                                                                                    </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

These errors, if not accurately modeled and predicted, can lead to significant deviations in positioning and timing solutions. This challenge tasks participants with developing and applying generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to model and predict the differences between uploaded (broadcast) and ICD based modelled values. The goal is to produce highly accurate error predictions for future time intervals, enhancing the reliability and precision of GNSS applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detailed Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participants will be provided with a seven-day dataset containing recorded clock and ephemeris errors between uploaded and modeled values from GNSS satellites in both GEO/GSO and MEO. The models must be capable of predicting these errors at 15-minute intervals for an eighth day that is not included in the training data. Evaluation will focus on the accuracy of these predictions over various validity periods: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and up to 24 hours into the future from the last known data point.

These errors, if not accurately modeled and predicted, can lead to significant deviations in positioning and timing solutions. This challenge tasks participants with developing and applying generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to model and predict the differences between uploaded (broadcast) and ICD based modelled values. The goal is to produce highly accurate error predictions for future time intervals, enhancing the reliability and precision of GNSS applications.<br><br><b>Detailed Description</b><br>Participants will be provided with a seven-day dataset containing recorded clock and ephemeris errors between uploaded and modeled values from GNSS satellites in both GEO/GSO and MEO. The models must be capable of predicting these errors at 15-minute intervals for an eighth day that is not included in the training data. Evaluation will focus on the accuracy of these predictions over various validity periods: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and up to 24 hours into the future from the last known data point.

To address this gap effectively, Design and Develop an AI-powered mobile application that:&lt;br&gt;• Provides role-based daily safety prompts and checklists based on the specific task assigned to each mine worker.&lt;br&gt;• Delivers short, engaging safety videos (&quot;&quot;Video of the Day&quot;&quot;)—animated or real—based on:&lt;br&gt;- Previous mine accident case studies,&lt;br&gt;- DGMS advisories,&lt;br&gt;- Testimonials from experienced miners, and&lt;br&gt;- Global best practices in mining safety (e.g., MSHA-USA, HSE-UK, Work Safe-Australia etc.).&lt;br&gt;• Includes a hazard reporting module with photo/video upload and multilingual voice support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mining is one of the most hazardous occupations globally. The DGMS under the Mines Act, 1952 provides safety guidelines, but many accidents still occur due to preventable causes like ignoring PPE, mishandling equipment, or inadequate training, roof or side fall accidents in underground coal mines, Machinery entanglement and unguarded conveyors, Inadequate blasting practices, and poor communication of hazards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected Solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This proposal leverages digital familiarity among workers to build a behavior-change tool.

To address this gap effectively, Design and Develop an AI-powered mobile application that:<br>• Provides role-based daily safety prompts and checklists based on the specific task assigned to each mine worker.<br>• Delivers short, engaging safety videos (\"\"Video of the Day\"\")—animated or real—based on:<br>- Previous mine accident case studies,<br>- DGMS advisories,<br>- Testimonials from experienced miners, and<br>- Global best practices in mining safety (e.g., MSHA-USA, HSE-UK, Work Safe-Australia etc.).<br>• Includes a hazard reporting module with photo/video upload and multilingual voice support.<br><br><b>Description</b><br>Mining is one of the most hazardous occupations globally. The DGMS under the Mines Act, 1952 provides safety guidelines, but many accidents still occur due to preventable causes like ignoring PPE, mishandling equipment, or inadequate training, roof or side fall accidents in underground coal mines, Machinery entanglement and unguarded conveyors, Inadequate blasting practices, and poor communication of hazards.<br><br><b>Expected Solution</b><br>This proposal leverages digital familiarity among workers to build a behavior-change tool. Using engaging content similar to YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels of Health Safety Environment (HSE) awareness can become a part of the worker's daily routine.

In the evolving threat landscape, cyber adversaries are increasingly focusing on the personal devices and digital footprints of defence personnel, their families, and ex-servicemen.&lt;br&gt;1.2. These individuals constitute prime and high-value targets; exploitation of their personal communications, social interactions, or financial activity can escalate into espionage, honeytraps, identity compromise, or targeted malware intrusions.&lt;br&gt;1.3. At present, complaints are routed through the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP), which is overloaded with civilian cases.&lt;br&gt;1.4. As the NCRP does not accord any priority to defence-related complaints, incidents with potential national security implications may remain undetected or delayed in response, thereby increasing operational risk.&lt;br&gt;1.5. A dedicated AI-driven cyber incident portal is therefore required to ensure faster detection, timely triage, and controlled escalation for defence-linked cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problem Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.1. The proposed solution is an AI-enabled Defence Cyber Incident &amp; Safety Portal, designed exclusively for serving personnel, their families, and veterans.&lt;br&gt;2.2. The portal must serve as a secure intake, triage, and alerting mechanism for cyber complaints with a direct linkage to CERT-Army.&lt;br&gt;2.3. The system should:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.1. Accept multi-format forensic samples (suspicious text messages, URLs, images, audio, video, and files).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.2. Analyze inputs using AI/ML models to identify malicious content, espionage patterns, or targeted threat campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.3. Provide real-time alerts and recommended mitigation steps to the complainant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.4. Generate segregated, priority- and risk-wise lists of incidents for CERT-Army, enabling swift and structured response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.5 Maintain role-based access controls, strict audit trails, and compliance with defence data-security norms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected Solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.1 Students are expected to develop a Defence Cyber Incident &amp; Safety Portal that will:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.1.1. Ingest and securely store complaints with forensic evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.1.2. Perform AI-enabled classification of incidents (fraud, malware, phishing, espionage indicators, OPSEC risk).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3.1.3.

In the evolving threat landscape, cyber adversaries are increasingly focusing on the personal devices and digital footprints of defence personnel, their families, and ex-servicemen.<br>1.2. These individuals constitute prime and high-value targets; exploitation of their personal communications, social interactions, or financial activity can escalate into espionage, honeytraps, identity compromise, or targeted malware intrusions.<br>1.3. At present, complaints are routed through the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP), which is overloaded with civilian cases.<br>1.4. As the NCRP does not accord any priority to defence-related complaints, incidents with potential national security implications may remain undetected or delayed in response, thereby increasing operational risk.<br>1.5. A dedicated AI-driven cyber incident portal is therefore required to ensure faster detection, timely triage, and controlled escalation for defence-linked cases.<br><br><b>Problem Description</b><br>2.1. The proposed solution is an AI-enabled Defence Cyber Incident &amp; Safety Portal, designed exclusively for serving personnel, their families, and veterans.<br>2.2. The portal must serve as a secure intake, triage, and alerting mechanism for cyber complaints with a direct linkage to CERT-Army.<br>2.3. The system should:-<br><ul><li>2.3.1. Accept multi-format forensic samples (suspicious text messages, URLs, images, audio, video, and files).</li><li>2.3.2. Analyze inputs using AI/ML models to identify malicious content, espionage patterns, or targeted threat campaigns.</li><li>2.3.3. Provide real-time alerts and recommended mitigation steps to the complainant.</li><li>2.3.4. Generate segregated, priority- and risk-wise lists of incidents for CERT-Army, enabling swift and structured response.</li><li>2.3.5 Maintain role-based access controls, strict audit trails, and compliance with defence data-security norms.</li></ul><br><b>Expected Solution</b><br>3.1 Students are expected to develop a Defence Cyber Incident &amp; Safety Portal that will:-<br><ul><li>3.1.1. Ingest and securely store complaints with forensic evidence.</li><li>3.1.2. Perform AI-enabled classification of incidents (fraud, malware, phishing, espionage indicators, OPSEC risk).</li><li>3.1.3. Issue immediate alerts to users when malicious content is detected.</li><li>3.1.4. Deliver automated playbook-style mitigation steps to guide users and responders.</li><li>3.1.5. Provide CERT-Army with risk-ranked dashboards and actionable intelligence.</li><li>3.1.6 Be deployed as both a secure web portal and a mobile application for accessibility in field conditions.</li></ul></div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Defence (MoD) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Army Cyber Group \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Defence personnel, veterans, and their families are increasingly targeted by adversaries through social engineering, malicious applications, and compromised communication channels.&lt;br&gt;1.2. Currently, most rely on commercial platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger), which allow unrestricted forwarding, uncontrolled group membership, and data sharing outside trusted circles.&lt;br&gt;1.3. Personal or family-level communication, though seemingly informal, can still contain sensitive references, OPSEC indicators, or behavioural patterns exploitable by hostile intelligence.&lt;br&gt;1.4. Adversaries can also exploit these platforms via malware-injected files, phishing links, or fake accounts, leading to surveillance or targeted campaigns.&lt;br&gt;1.5. There is no dedicated, defence-exclusive platform that works over open/public networks but ensures controlled membership, encryption, and strict containment of communication.&lt;br&gt;1.6.

The proposed solution is a VPN-tunnel based secure communication application operable over existing public internet and telecom infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;2.2.

Provide secure text, voice, video, and file-sharing features limited to the group environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.4. Prevent information leakage by disabling cross-platform forwarding (e.g., blocking export to WhatsApp, email, or cloud drives).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.5. Enforce copy-paste restrictions, screenshot blocking, and local export control to ensure containment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2.3.6.

One of the key diagnostic techniques used to assess the health of these breakers is Dynamic Contact Resistance Measurement (DCRM), which captures the resistance profile of moving contacts during operation.

These substations consist of complex assets such as circuit breakers, transformers, isolators, busbars, and protection systems, all of which require continuous monitoring and maintenance to ensure grid reliability.

In the context of the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Semester 5 for internships refers to the fifth semester of a 4-year undergraduate degree (typically under the Multidisciplinary Four-Year Undergraduate Programme). Key features of NEP include:&lt;br&gt;\n1. Emphasis on Experiential Learning – NEP promotes hands-on learning through internships, fieldwork, and apprenticeships. Semester 5 is typically when students have completed basic foundational and disciplinary courses, and they are ready for practical exposure to apply their knowledge in real-life settings.&lt;br&gt;\n2. Timing in the 4-Year Program – In a 4-year UG program: Semester 1-2: Foundation courses; Semester 3-4: Major-specific and interdisciplinary subjects; Semester 5-6: Internships, field projects, or community engagement; Semester 7-8: Research, specialization, or advanced projects. Semester 5 is when students begin industry, research, or community internships to gain practical experience.&lt;br&gt;\n3. Flexibility in Internships – Internships may be in industries relevant to the student&#039;s major, with NGOs, government departments, or research institutions, and can be short-term (during summer) or extended (as part of credit-based coursework).&lt;br&gt;\n4. Credit-Based Evaluation – Internships under NEP can be credit-bearing, i.e., they count towards the student&#039;s academic score, and students are often required to submit a report or presentation to reflect learning outcomes.&lt;br&gt;\n5. Career Readiness – By Semester 5, students begin career exploration, networking, and gaining experience that prepares them for final-year placements, startups or entrepreneurship, and higher education or research.&lt;br&gt;\nIn short, &quot;Semester 5 for internships&quot; in NEP means students, by the 5th semester of their undergraduate program, should engage in industry or field-based internships to develop practical skills, gain exposure, and align learning with real-world needs, in line with NEP&#039;s emphasis on holistic and experiential education.&lt;br&gt;\nThe internship system often fails in colleges—especially under the NEP model—for several critical reasons:&lt;br&gt;\n1. Lack of Industry Tie-ups – Limited partnerships with companies, no proper MoUs or placement cells.&lt;br&gt;\n2. Poor Planning and Late Implementation – Programs introduced suddenly without planning.&lt;br&gt;\n3. No Monitoring or Mentorship – No faculty supervision or follow-up.&lt;br&gt;\n4. Students Not Industry-Ready – Lack of skills discourages companies from taking interns.&lt;br&gt;\n5. Unavailability of Quality Internships in Rural/Remote Areas – Limited industry presence; ineffective online internships.&lt;br&gt;\n6. Administrative and Logistical Failures – Poor coordination, lack of funding, and unclear guidelines.&lt;br&gt;\n7. Fake Internships and Certificate Mills – Students buying certificates or joining non-functional organizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSolution for the gap is student-industry-college tie-up to develop an app for solving internship system failures, which can be a powerful and sustainable solution.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Stakeholders &amp; Their Roles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n1.

Industry Partners – Share real-time internship openings, provide API access or dashboards to manage intern applications, offer short-term/remote internship slots for trial, work in hybrid mode.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Implementation Strategy&lt;/b&gt; – Stakeholder collaboration with government education departments, college faculty, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach; technology development partner to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features; pilot launch in select districts; full-scale rollout through government colleges and skill centers; real-time monitoring and feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Expected Outcomes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n1.

Various types of vulnerabilities are being identified on regular basis in various applications and protocols. Among them, HTTP is one of the key protocols in functioning of Internet. HTTP is also most exploited protocol by the cyber threat actors. Numerous types of attacks are being carried out using HTTP protocol, specially using URL field. The proposal is to create system which identifies the various kind of cyber-attacks being carried out by exploiting URL field of HTTP protocol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system aims to develop capabilities to detect possible attacks attempts, as also identify confirmed/successful attacks based on IPDR. The system may be developed using simulated data generated using available cyber security tools. Some of the suggestive tools includes SQLmap, Burp Suite, XSStrike Commix etc. The system aims to detect following type of URL based attacks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a. Typosquatting or URL spoofing attack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;b. SQL injection (can be multiple types)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;c. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) (can be multiple types)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;d.

Various types of vulnerabilities are being identified on regular basis in various applications and protocols. Among them, HTTP is one of the key protocols in functioning of Internet. HTTP is also most exploited protocol by the cyber threat actors. Numerous types of attacks are being carried out using HTTP protocol, specially using URL field. The proposal is to create system which identifies the various kind of cyber-attacks being carried out by exploiting URL field of HTTP protocol.<br><br><b>Description</b><br>The system aims to develop capabilities to detect possible attacks attempts, as also identify confirmed/successful attacks based on IPDR. The system may be developed using simulated data generated using available cyber security tools. Some of the suggestive tools includes SQLmap, Burp Suite, XSStrike Commix etc. The system aims to detect following type of URL based attacks:<br><ul><li>a. Typosquatting or URL spoofing attack</li><li>b. SQL injection (can be multiple types)</li><li>c. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) (can be multiple types)</li><li>d. Directory Traversal</li><li>e.

These threats are hard to find using traditional security tools, because such tools are mostly built to catch external problems like malware, phishing, or DDoS attacks. Unlike outside attacks that follow known patterns, internal threats often come from trusted users who misuse their access, making it difficult to spot their actions or making them hard to distinguish from normal activities. As organizations grow and their IT environments become more complex, the volume of user activity and system logs increases exponentially, making manual monitoring impractical. Also, the use of cloud services, remote work, and third-party access makes it even harder to track and manage internal risks. This is where UEBA plays a critical role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;UEBA is the solution to the above problem of insider attacks. It can address this issue by analyzing user behavior, using historical activity data to predict potential internal threats through advanced analytics. UEBA is emerging as a disruptive technology in the areas of cybersecurity, empowering organizations to detect technologically advanced threats by analyzing behavioral signatures of both internal and external users. UEBA unlike other proactive security solutions doesn’t solely rely on static rules, rather it leverages Machine Learning (ML) and sophisticated statistical tools to identify anomalies that may indicate insider threats, compromised accounts or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected Solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution is expected to be composed of four modules. The first is data collection module, where data is gathered from system logs, applications, endpoints, servers, and various network devices. The second module is data normalization, which converts the collected data into a common format for easier analysis. The third module is data analytics, where the processed data is analysed.

These threats are hard to find using traditional security tools, because such tools are mostly built to catch external problems like malware, phishing, or DDoS attacks. Unlike outside attacks that follow known patterns, internal threats often come from trusted users who misuse their access, making it difficult to spot their actions or making them hard to distinguish from normal activities. As organizations grow and their IT environments become more complex, the volume of user activity and system logs increases exponentially, making manual monitoring impractical. Also, the use of cloud services, remote work, and third-party access makes it even harder to track and manage internal risks. This is where UEBA plays a critical role.<br><br><b>Description</b><br>UEBA is the solution to the above problem of insider attacks. It can address this issue by analyzing user behavior, using historical activity data to predict potential internal threats through advanced analytics. UEBA is emerging as a disruptive technology in the areas of cybersecurity, empowering organizations to detect technologically advanced threats by analyzing behavioral signatures of both internal and external users. UEBA unlike other proactive security solutions doesn’t solely rely on static rules, rather it leverages Machine Learning (ML) and sophisticated statistical tools to identify anomalies that may indicate insider threats, compromised accounts or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).<br><br><b>Expected Solution</b><br>The solution is expected to be composed of four modules. The first is data collection module, where data is gathered from system logs, applications, endpoints, servers, and various network devices. The second module is data normalization, which converts the collected data into a common format for easier analysis. The third module is data analytics, where the processed data is analysed. Machine learning algorithms and other mathematical models may be incorporated, to detect significant deviations from the normal baseline. If any suspicious activity or potential threat is detected, the system generates anomaly alerts based on these findings.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Defence (MoD) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

While employees at headquarters are engaged in administrative tasks such as file processing, approvals, and correspondence, the field units are responsible for highly technical and project-oriented work such as preparation of Master Plans, Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), surveys, design, monitoring, and execution of various projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, there is no structured digital mechanism to evaluate performance of employees across these diverse functions on the basis of quantifiable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The existing Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR) system is largely subjective, based on the perception of reporting officers, and does not provide a continuous, data-driven, and transparent mechanism for measuring productivity.

While employees at headquarters are engaged in administrative tasks such as file processing, approvals, and correspondence, the field units are responsible for highly technical and project-oriented work such as preparation of Master Plans, Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), surveys, design, monitoring, and execution of various projects.<br><br>Currently, there is no structured digital mechanism to evaluate performance of employees across these diverse functions on the basis of quantifiable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The existing Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR) system is largely subjective, based on the perception of reporting officers, and does not provide a continuous, data-driven, and transparent mechanism for measuring productivity. For example, while one official may appear to be only processing receipts and replies on files, another may be supervising the preparation of DPRs or monitoring field execution — both require different but measurable parameters for productivity assessment.<br><br>The absence of such a system results in lack of accountability, absence of performance benchmarking, and limited scope for identifying inefficiencies or rewarding good performance.

So troops are bound to carry two different type of equipment for communication and tracking purpose.\nExpected solution: \na)VHF radio set should be design with GPS tracking facility and independent of VHF communication range.\nb)When the radio set goes beyond the VHF range of Base Station, it can communicate to its location through satellite network and through GSM network.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Border Security Force(BSF) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

To address the issue of increasing cybercrimes, the proactive approach shall be adopted.\nDescription:\nThis framework focuses on the mitigation of cybercrimes by the adopting a proactive approach.  This framework’s output will enable the prediction of likely cash withdrawal locations, which, in turn, will allow Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) at the state and local levels, coordinated by I4C, to implement proactive interventions. These interventions could include deploying special teams or alerting local banks and ATMs in high-risk areas.  The intelligence generated would also help banks and Financial Institutions (FIs) through the Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System, enabling faster, fund blocking and increasing the chances of recovery. By supporting real-time actionable intelligence sharing across jurisdictions, law enforcement agencies and Banks/FIs will be able to respond faster and more effectively to cyber threats.  This approach goes beyond merely reacting to complaints and creates a powerful, data-driven defense against financial cyber frauds, strengthening India’s overall cybersecurity posture.  Enhancing coordination between law enforcement and financial entities will ensure better detection and prevention of financial crimes, creating a more unified and efficient approach to combating cybercrime.\nKey Deliverable:\nComponent                                                                                     Description \na.

Widely used in manufacturing products like gunny bags, ropes, carpets, jute diversified products etc. It is valued for its low cost, colour, lustre and strength. The extraction of jute fibre is known as jute retting. The traditional approach to jute retting involves harvesting of 100 to 120 days mature jute plants, bundling them, and immersing the bundles in water bodies such as rivers or ponds. Traditional water retting is very popular in our country however, retting of whole jute crop requires large quantity of clean water. Due to weather vagaries in recent years, jute retting has been badly affected by scarcity of water during the harvesting time i.e., July August months in the jute growing belts of India (mainly in Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Meghalaya, Odisha, Nagaland, Tripura). The condition has forced the farmers to use the stagnant and insufficient water over and over again for retting, which ultimately leads to poor quality of fibre and economic loss for the farmers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many research institutes like ICAR-CRIJAF, ICAR-NINFET etc. have developed a new method of retting known as ribbon retting Prior to retting, sticks are separated and the fiber-containing bark part of the jute stems is allowed to ret underwater, which requires very less amount of water and reduces the regular retting time by 4 to 5 days (generally traditional retting takes time of about 20 to 25 days). Thus, the process takes around 15 to 18 days to complete the retting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The institutes have developed power-operated Jute Ribboner machine for the extraction of jute ribbons from freshly harvested jute plants without breaking sticks. It is powered by a single phase 3 hp electric motor and can be operated by a 5 hp Diesel engine with slight modification. It consists of two sets of stick breaker-cum-ribbon pulling units placed one above the other. Five to six jute plants can be fed in one set of breaker units, there by 10-12 plants can be extracted at a time by two units. The principle involves feeding jute plants by the butt end in between the upper breaking rollers, which crushes the stick about 5 cm, and then pulling off the ribbon by the lower rollers at high speed and placing the ribbon on the conveyor belt for delivery at front side of the machine. The sticks of the feeding plants were ejected intact from the upper tray of the machine. The existing machines involves two-way operation for complete ribbon extraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another power operated portable machine named &quot;&quot;Bast Fibre Extractor was developed by ICAR-CRIJAF, Barrackpore to extract green ribbon from jute, mesta, sunnhemp and ramie plants by breaking the stick into small pieces. The machine works on the principle of beating the canes progressively down its length and scrapping when the operator pulls out the canes. It needs two workers for operation, one for feeding the canes and its ribbon separation in the machine and the other for helping in relay of the canes and removing wastes. The machine salvages ribbon from thin plants (basal diameter less than 0.5 cm), which is normally discarded under conventional method. Such thin plants constitute about 15% by weight of total harvested biomass, which is added to the total fibre yield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even after such efforts from the researches by developing new methods of ribbon retting in small volume of water and getting better quality of fibre, some issues like, manual feeding of jute plants in the ribboner, low extraction efficiency, breaking of inner jute sticks, less transportability etc., have left the machines less appreciated and adaptability is very poor among the farmers. They require high capacity and cost-effective ribboner machines capable of ribboning more quantity of jute plants in short period of time and easy to carry near to the jute fields so that they can easily carry the jute bark/ribbon to nearby small ponds or waterbodies or in-situ excavated plots inside jute fields for retting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expected Solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The efficiency of the ribboning machines needs to be enhanced to extract ribbons from high volume of green plants in a short period of time to make them more cost effective and needs better portability.

A farmer profiling system would enable targeted interventions tailored to the needs of smallholders, and community dashboards showcasing success stories could build trust, inspire confidence, and encourage wider adoption of oil palm cultivation.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare (MoA&amp;FW) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>\n                                Department of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare (DoA&amp;FW) (Oil Palm) \n                                <!-- echo $user_info->department;  -->\n                            </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Agriculture, FoodTech &amp; Rural Development</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                          <!--                             <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                \n                                    <br>\n                                     <a href=\"\"><br></a>\n                                 <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/dataset/\"><br></a>\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr> -->\n                                                                <tr>\n                                    <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                                    <td>\n                                                                            </td>\n                                    </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

They should aim to learn about additive manufacturing and its applications in aerospace design. This includes studying how to design aerospace components with considerations for structural integrity, and weight reduction. They should define project objectives and design constraints, and then utilize generative design tools in Fusion to explore and generate optimized designs. The student should evaluate these designs using simulation and analysis tools within Fusion. They should refine and iterate on the designs to further enhance performance. Finally, they should prototype and test the finalized design using appropriate 3D printing technologies.\n Teams choosing to submit idea for Autodesk├ö├ç├ûs problem statement are required to request their faculty (SIH SPOC) to fill this mandatory form.

However, the sun├ö├ç├ûs position changes throughout the day and across seasons, which can reduce the amount of sunlight that fixed solar panels receive.\nDescription: Traditional solar tracking systems often rely on electrical components and motors, which can be costly and require maintenance. A non-electrical tracking system offers a sustainable and low-maintenance alternative to enhance the efficiency of solar panels.\nExpected Solution: The problem statement is to develop a cost-effective, non-electrical device that can accurately track the sun├ö├ç├ûs movement and adjust the orientation of solar panels to maintain optimal exposure.

Non-contact methods, such as air-puff tonometry, offer a more convenient alternative but are often limited to clinical settings due to their size and cost.\nExpected Solution: Problem statement is to develop a cost-effective, portable, and non-contact device that can measure IOP accurately and reliably with safety. This device should be easy to use, and allowing patients to use at home.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Department of Science and Technology\n </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Science and Technology </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each.\nTwo aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine ├ö├ç├┤ The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important.\nTKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour\nIt is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation.\nTKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour)\nWhere, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift.\nAssessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory.\nMore is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must.\nActions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL├ö├ç├ûs dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle├ö├ç├ûs Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition.\nTyre Pressure\nProper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources.\nExpected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime.\nTyre Performance Analysis\nApart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres.\nSuch analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Coal </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Central Mine Planning &amp; Design Institute Limited </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Interactive exhibits are the lifeblood of science centers, but keeping them functioning smoothly can be a challenge. It poses the problem of regular maintenance. It has also been observed that defects remain unattended for long due to not being identified. It creates a genuine problem for the visitors' experience and sometimes they are not aware of the optimum result. Here lines the requirement for an automated defective exhibit identification system.\nDescription:\nIt is a real-life problem in big Museum/ Science Museum/Centres, where there is inadequacy of manpower. Following are the problems in a nutshell that arose due to unnoticed and undiagnosed defects of the exhibits.\nHigh Maintenance Needs: Unlike static displays, interactive elements have more moving parts, software, and technology that require regular upkeep to function properly these are considered as \"\"golden parameters of any particular Exhibits\"\". Theses parameters are to be kept functional to keep the exhibits in a running condition.\nFrustration for Visitors: Encountering a non-functional exhibit can be frustrating for visitors, especially children, who may not understand why it's not working.\nMissed Learning Opportunities: Broken/ non-functional exhibits prevent visitors from fully engaging with the science concepts they're designed to teach.\nBecause of their complexity, malfunctions might not be immediately obvious to visitors or staff, leading to a broken experience. Also creates a bad impression for that particular gallery and ultimately to the science center or to Science Museums.\nExpected Solution:\nNow, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, it transpires that amalgamation of Al with automation may give efficient result to detect defective exhibits placed in the galleries and give the feedback to the concerned section for immediate repairing initiative and rectify the exhibits. Thus, aiming a flawless learning experience or edutainment in Science Museum or in Science Center.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Culture </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Council of Science Museums </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Background. UIDAI has implemented app-based face authentication solution. This solution uses the support of the backend service to secure the captured image using PKI technology, so that it can be used by the authentication system. UIDAI intends to avoid this network call for encryption and implement an in-device solution to enable PKI implementation.\n2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to develop a solution that is platform agnostic i.e applicable for both Android and IOS platforms, and will derive the root of trust from the hardware of the device. The key pair so generated with the help of hardware is to identify the device uniquely and must connect it with IMEI number or any such unique number of the mobile device. The solution must meet the following requirements:-\n3. The proposed solution must meet the following objectives.\n3.1 Feature Requirement. The solution must use hardware to generate a key pair to uniquely identify the device. The private key of the certificate par must remain in the hardware and must not be extractable. All encryption must be performed within the hardware enclave (i.e in hardware) to protect the private key.\n3.2 The solution must support key lifecycle management i.e key expiry or revocation.\n3.3 The solution must be completely offline i.e. should not use any backend component for implementation of the PKI security.\n3.4 The solution must enable UIDAI to use RSA PKCS or OAEP encryption protocols.\n4. Expected Solution. The expected outcome of this project is a functionalsolution that demonstrates the PKI encryption of blob data in the mobile device using a key pair that is linked to the device hardware.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Co-ordination Division </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is\nthe bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons.\nDescription: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods.\nExpected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Animal Husbandry &amp; Dairying </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

To improve the productivity of animals a major focus area is to breed these animals using semen from high genetic merit bulls through Artificial lnsemination (Al). Al enables farmers to access the best bull (male) genetics. Farmers can improve the production, health traits, fertility and longevity of their dairy cattle by using a balanced approach to breeding. Animal health is also improved through the use of Al.\nDescription: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery\nsystem in lndia.\nSemen doses are currently stored and transported using liquid nitrogen and specialized containers. However, significant losses of liquid nitrogen occur during storage and transportation, leading to escalated costs for maintaining the cold chain. The cost of liquid nitrogen itself is an issue. Mishandling of liquid nitrogen poses potential health hazards. The bulky and heavy nature of liquid nitrogen storage containers necessitates considerable resou rces for transportation.\nExpected solution:\n. There is a need to explore and promote alternative, cost-effective, and long-lasting methods for the storage and transportation of semen doses\n. The design, material, type of insulation of storage containers can also help in cost effectiveness, reduction in losses, compactness and ease of carrying to facilitate efficient distribution.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Animal Husbandry &amp; Dairying </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Agriculture, FoodTech &amp; Rural Development</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.\nDescription: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances)\nExpected Solution: A hardware/software/chemical solution for end-to-end tracking of dual use chemicals used in both legitimate industries and illicit drug production from point of manufacture to point of end use/export\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Automatic change detection on such images have wider application for various use cases.\nDescription: Change detection between two SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite images are straight forward if they are co-registered as the difference or ratio of corresponding pixels of the two images itself will give the change map. But such change maps will invariably have many natural changes as well like water body extent, flood extent, snow cover and forest cover changes etc. Our interest is to detect only man made changes and avoid natural changes.\nThe solution can make use of Sentinel 1 SAR Open source satellite images and Google Earth Engine platform to access them. These images are co-registered by default. The GRD (Ground Range Detected) intensity image version of the Sentinel 1 SAR is to be used. Please note that images with same viewing geometry are better suited for change detection purposes. The solution should give the option for the user to vary the thresholds if any used for filtering change results. The change output should be in the form of polygons in a geographically referenced vector file.

Using this continuous spectral information classification of diverse material of interest can be done accurately. The availability of huge information due to continuous spectral information improves data information content but causing challenges in processing of hyperspectral images. An unsupervised learning mechanism for detection of targets by optimizing Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Image Processing using AI/ML can be used for it.\nDescription: The above problem statement envisages, that Hyperspectral data to be processed in such a way that to find spectrally distinct and most informative pixels in the data to identify anomalies in the data. Before processing of data, data correction methods, to improve interpretation of pixel spectra and better result to analyse data can be done. Different approaches for de-noising to remove noise from data, fusion approach through sharpening or pan sharpening can be implemented. The calibration of data using radiometric and atmospheric correction methods can be implemented to optimize the result. An anomaly detection model based on deep learning with best performance to be implemented to process hyperspectral data which can provide clear identification of anomalies in the data with sufficient spectral clarity. Subsequently, the same can be created as spectral signatures of the objects. A suitable target detection methodology for identifying target of interest is also to be developed. \nExpected Solution: A deep learning models for processing of hyperspectral data based on anomaly detection to be optimized that can be used for target detection in that data using available open source hyperspectral data of Hyperion, AVIRIS etc. to be developed.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                Open source Hyperspectral resources Hyperion/AVIRIS-NG<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/Open source Hyperspectral resources Hyperion/AVIRIS-NG\">Open source Hyperspectral resources Hyperion/AVIRIS-NG<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Greywater Management is encouraged to be implemented as close to source as possible to reduce cost and complexity. Preferably, greywater should be managed at the household level, with community-level management as a secondary option, and management at the Drain End Point considered only as a last resort.

An essential aspect of the mission's success is not only ensuring access to water but also guaranteering its quality. Residual chlorine/Silver ion levels indicate the efficacy of water disinfection, bacteriological contamination poses significant health risks. Existing methods for testing water quality at the household level often lack reliability, accessibility, and affordability. The main aim of the technology challenge is to develop three distinct personalised testing kits (For measuring Residual chlorine, residual silver ion and/or for Bacteriological contamination) that are cost-effective, easy to use, and could measure both residual chlorine levels and bacteriological contamination at the household level. Thse devices are intented to empower rural communities to conduct their own assessments of water quality, enabling prompt action to ensure safe drinking water. Expected Solutions: i. The device should be portable and accurate in detecting low levels of residual chlorine (As per BIS 10500: 2012, acceptable limit: 0.2 mg/liter), residual silver ions and/or bacteriological contamination (E. coli &amp; Total coliform- As per BIS 10500: 2012, it shall not be detectable in any 100 ml of sample), ensuring reliable results comparable to laboratory-grade equipment. ii. The detected value indicates the level of chlorine/silver ion/bacteria (E.Coli) present in 100 ml water. The output of the test should be in digital mode; iii. The personalized testing kits should be affordable for rural households, easy to carry &amp; use and requiring minimal training for operation by individuals. iv. The personalized testing kits should be robust and able to withstand harsh environmental conditions prevalent in rural India, suhc as temperature fulctuations and humidity. v. Quick turnaround time for obtaining results, allowing households to promptly assess water safety; vi. The personalized testing kits should easy to calibrate; vii. Low operation and maintenance; viii.

As a result of this water flows from such well automatically and pumping devices are not required. Such autoflow wells are observed mostly in the Terai region of India. As shown by the aquifer mapping studies, the extents of autoflow areas are shrinking in parts of Uttarakhand and elsewhere. \nMany private wells in these terrains are without any cap or tap and water flows continuously leading to huge groundwater losses. \nFurther, measurement of head (water level) in these wells is a challenge as water flows automatically from these wells. Usually an additional pipe is attached above the ground level and the water level in such a pipes is measured manually. \nThe proposal is to develop a device that can serve two purposes- i) it will work as a safe cap for the well with a tap for regulating water flow and ii) a pressure transducer based sensor that can sense the pressure and translate it in terms of height (in m) above ground level</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). \nHowever, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. \nDescription: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&amp;ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. \nExpected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&amp;ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. \nThese KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Robotics and Drones</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

This variability can strain the power grid, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues. Traditional grid infrastructure is not designed to handle these fluctuations effectively, resulting in energy wastage and a reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power. Energy storage systems (ESS) offer a potential solution by storing excess energy generated during peak production periods and releasing it during times of high demand or low generation, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.\n\nDescription:\nThe task is to design an innovative and efficient energy storage system to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources and stabilize the grid. This requires addressing several key challenges: high costs, technological limitations, and regulatory barriers. Current ESS technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, pumped hydro storage, and flow batteries, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Innovative ideas need to be explored to reduce costs, enhance storage capacities, and improve the efficiency and lifespan of these technologies. Additionally, how to navigate and potentially reform regulatory frameworks to support the widespread adoption of ESS may also be explored.\n\nExpected Solution:\nDevelop approaches to lower the initial and operational costs of ESS, potentially through new materials, manufacturing processes, or economies of scale. Identify or create advanced ESS technologies that offer higher efficiency, greater storage capacity, and longer operational lifespans.

Unlike its fossil fuel counterpart, green hydrogen emits no greenhouse gasses at the point of use, making it ideal for hard-to-electrify sectors like heavy industry, long-distance transport, and steel production. This clean fuel can power vehicles and industrial processes, slashing emissions and combating climate change. Furthermore, green hydrogen's potential for energy storage allows for a more balanced and resilient renewable energy grid. As we strive for a net-zero future, green hydrogen is a crucial tool for a cleaner and more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nDescription:\nGreen hydrogen's potential for clean energy is undeniable. However, its widespread adoption faces a significant roadblock: high levelized cost. This cost, encompassing production, storage, and transportation, makes green hydrogen less competitive compared to traditional fossil fuels. This disparity discourages industries from switching to green alternatives. Government incentives, technological advancements, and economies of scale are all crucial to bridge this cost gap. Only then can green hydrogen fulfil its promise as a transformative force in the fight against climate change.\n\nExpected Solution:\nThe Project details should include definitive inputs on:\nSizing of production capacity.\nProduction technology, useful life, replacement costs etc.\nProposed RTC-RE model (if production is through electrolysers).\nProposed sourcing of Feedstock\nExpected plant CUF.\nEntire Financial Model with detailed breakup for CAPEX &amp; OPEX.\nStorage technologies used (with compliance of safety standards) and their cost.\nApproaches used to lower levelized cost during project modelling.\nPolicy and Regulatory support required.\nScope for further cost optimisation through economies of scale.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Emissions of methane following the disposal of waste in landfill account for a large share of GHG emissions from waste management.\n\nDescription:\nWith increasing pressure of development and urbanization, the need for efficient municipal service delivery is also growing rapidly, which the municipal bodies are very often unable to cope with. This is true in case of solid waste disposal and management as well. The main objectives of solid waste management are to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, promote recycling, and minimize the negative effects of waste on the environment and human health\n\nExpected Solution:\nDeveloping Community based solution for collection and recycling of solid waste management for developing into Net Zero waste communities.\nDigital solution for tracking the waste generation to waste recycling giving the effective tracking mechanism to utilities to collect, account and manage waste.\nDeveloping local solution for recycling of waste by Torrefaction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Pellets converting it into valuable product to get bioenergy\nInnovative solution for waste management to reduce LFG and Collecting and Treating Landfill Gas (LFG) and used as a renewable energy resource</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

It accounts for 55% of the country's energy need. The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost.\n\nDescription:\nCarbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5Ôö¼ÔûæC goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.\n\nExpected Solution:\nLow cost solution with indigenous technology development for carbon capture and utilisation.\nDeveloping solution for storage and transport of carbon which is more sustainable ecologically and environmentally\nConverting CO2 into value-added products, creating economic value from waste products and contributing to the circular carbon economy, building construction materials, fuels &amp; chemicals and carbon nano-materials.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Maybe the person is too weak to get up and shout down the stairs to find out if so, then this simple intercom will help him or her to get the information he or she needs. Deaf people are not able to hear and don't use oral language, they can see and communicate in Sign language and Sign language is a Visual language. So video call communication devices will be more accessible for the Deaf. Vibration sensors also will be help out in emergency to forward the information. It works without any charges like the telephones.\n\nDescription: In an office, business organization, Shops, stores and stressful in relating/delivering information to each other within a particular building. The servants find it laborious going to the boss always whenever he/she has information to deliver or wants to carry action with respect to the master├ö├ç├ûs authority. Therefore, this project work is to address this issue, looking forward to eliminating the stressful, manpower (Deaf) involved and to facilitate information delivery, making communication easier. The Intercom system formed the basis of this study and designed the HOD├ö├ç├ûs office and staff├ö├ç├ûs office for internal communication keeping the view of Deaf.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC)\n </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.\nDetailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:\n60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam\n40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam\n30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.\nSince January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student├ö├ç├ûs responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.\nExpected Solutions: To develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing pen and writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>NIEPID (National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Education</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as ├ö├ç┬úunexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,├ö├ç├ÿ are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual├ö├ç├ûs strength, balance, and mobility\nDescription: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants├ö├ç├û presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more\nThe recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people.\nExpected Solution:\nThese technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>NIEPID (National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Functional body powered upper limb prosthesis can replace the functions of upper limb for ADL activities up to some extent. But in higher level of upper limb amputation, it becomes difficult for the patient to manage ADL activities. The requirement of externally powered prosthesis such as myoelectric prosthesis plays a vital role in this aspect.\nDescription of Problem statement: \nA myoelectric prosthesis is an externally powered prosthesis which is controlled by muscle contraction (muscle action potential). In market, many variants of myoelectric prostheses are available with various features. The most important feature of these prostheses is the grasping pattern types and also it indicates about movement of different fingers in prosthesis. Because it is expensive, access to these high-end prosthesesbecomes challenging for patients with upper limb amputation living in developing nations like India. Even though few myoelectric prostheses are available in market with less cost, but the features are limited and are not working precisely. \nExpected Solutions: \nExperts from different disciplines, such as engineers for creating programs and fabrication of controlling circuits and Prosthetist for fabrication of sockets and fitment of the prostheses are required to design and develop a cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis. Most important feature of the prosthesis is the grasping pattern which is completely dependent on the prosthetic hand. Thus, design and fabrication of prosthetic hand also plays a vital role in the complete working mechanism of the prosthesis. Thus, to get a successful result, it is possible to work collaboratively with experts from different discipline.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>NIEPID (National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Rail defects such as cracks, fractures, and wear are critical issues in the railway industry, leading to safety hazards, operational disruptions, and increased maintenance costs. Early detection and prediction of these defects are essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of railway infrastructure. These defects are to be noticed while train is moving.\nDescription: The problem statement aims to develop an Al-based acoustic wave monitoring system for the early detection of rail defects and prediction of wear and quality parameters. The system will utilize acoustic waves to transmit to the rail tracks and its pattern will be monitored. The system will be capable of distinguishing between normal operating conditions and the presence of defects or abnormal wear patterns.\nExpected Solution: The proposed solution will involve the development of a comprehensive acoustic wave monitoring system for railway tracks. This system will consist of transmission side and reception side. Reception side sensors would be capable of predicting the track structure, quality of the rail and distance from a central fixed point.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Smart Cities Mission </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Transportation &amp; Logistics</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.\nBackground: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.\nDetailed Description:\nClassification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler├ö├ç├ûs, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.\nA Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.\nExpected Solution:\nInput: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird\nOutput: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Robotics and Drones</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

These fixed stations suffered from various limitations and generally do not give representative values e.g. station located near an industrial area will give higher readings due to proximity to such industrial area which may not be representative of the wider area. Similarly, a temporary construction site/activity near these fixed sites give higher pollution readings due to local reasons. The technological solutions may be required for capturing AQI values through mobile and other forms of stations. Drone would be one of the options where they can record real-time pollution parameters through on-board sensors.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of NCT of Delhi </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>IT Department, GNCTD </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The real-time monitoring of buses for effective route rationalization may be one of the challenges to prevent bunching of buses on a specific route or long delays in arrival of buses. The problem cannot be addressed by fixed time schedule owing to various factors like traffic Conditions, road conditions and other such factors.

We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.\nDescription:\nThe peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.\nFurther, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.\nExpected Solution:\nAn Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of NCT of Delhi </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>IT Department, GNCTD </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Traditional methods of classroom management are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error, which can disrupt the learning process. Leveraging software-based solutions in classroom management can enhance operational efficiency, ensure safety, and create an engaging learning atmosphere for students. This project aims to develop a smart software solution to streamline classroom operations, improve resource utilization, and enhance the overall learning experience.\nDetailed Description: The Smart Classroom Management Software (SCMS) can utilize advanced algorithms, data analytics, and cloud-based technologies to automate various aspects of classroom management. The system can potentially include (but not limited to) features such as:\n1. Attendance Automation:\nUse facial recognition algorithms or mobile app-based check-ins to automatically record student attendance.\nGenerate real-time attendance reports accessible by teachers and administration.\n2. Resource Management:\nTrack the usage of classroom resources such as projectors, computers, and other teaching aids through a centralized software platform.\nAutomate the scheduling and maintenance of these resources to minimize downtime.\n3. Safety and Security Alerts:\nImplement software-based alerts for emergencies such as fire, unauthorized access, or other security concerns, integrated with existing security systems.\nAlert authorities and stakeholders through real-time notifications and reports.\n4. Interactive Learning Tools:\nIntegration with existing smart boars and interactive displays to adapt to the teaching content and student needs.\nProvide real-time feedback and analytics on student engagement and performance.\n5. Data Analytics:\nCollect and analyse data on various classroom activities to provide insights into student behaviour, attendance patterns, and resource utilization.\nGenerate predictive reports to aid in decision-making and improve educational outcomes.\nAI-based Chabot for helping students to understand their learning gaps.\nExpected Output:\nA fully functional prototype of the Smart Classroom Management Software (SCMS) demonstrating the above features through the integration of advanced algorithms, data analytics, and cloud-based technologic.\nA user-friendly interface for students, (teachers and administrators to interact with the system and access reports.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of NCT of Delhi </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>IT Department, GNCTD </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

There is a need for an intelligent system that not only matches job seekers with potential employers but also identifies and suggests training courses to bridge skill gaps. We wish to design a competency diagnostic which would ask a series of questions to students to test their competence and based on their scores in the test, recommend jobs to them and also appropriate training courses to them to cover the gaps in their skill curve.\nRequirements:\n1. AI-Powered Job/Training Recommendation System:\n├ö├ç├│ Implement an AI-based recommendation system trained on multiple data points (e.g., skills, experience, preferences) to analyze job seekers' profiles and recommend suitable job opportunities.\n├ö├ç├│ Training Course Recommendations: Suggest relevant online courses, workshops, and training programs based on the desired job roles.\n2. Skill Gap Analysis and Recommendations:\n├ö├ç├│ Gap Identification: The recommendation System should assess job seekers' competencies against the requirements of their desired job roles to identify areas for improvement.\n├ö├ç├│ Personalized Suggestions: Provide tailored recommendations for online courses, workshops, and training programs to help job seekers upskill and close identified gaps.\n3. Adaptive Learning Pathways:\n├ö├ç├│ Personalized Learning: Develop adaptive learning pathways based on the job seeker's progress and feedback.\n├ö├ç├│ Content Variety: Offer a mix of micro-courses, webinars, and hands-on projects relevant to the job market to enhance learning and skill development.\n4. Real-Time Job Market Insights based on candidate├ö├ç├ûs skills and competencies:\n├ö├ç├│ Dashboard: Create a dashboard displaying real-time data on trending jobs, skills in demand, and salary benchmarks.\n├ö├ç├│ Data Analytics: Use data analytics to provide insights into job market trends and forecast future skill requirements.\n5. Skills Verification and Certification:\n├ö├ç├│ Skill Assessments: Implement a system for verifying skills and certifying competencies through assessments and tests.\n├ö├ç├│ Badges and Certifications: Offer badges and certifications that candidates can display on their profiles and share on social media platforms like LinkedIn.\n6. Resume Wizard\n├ö├ç├│ Automated Resume Building: Develop a resume wizard to help candidates automatically build their resumes based on their profiles, ensuring a professional and comprehensive presentation of their skills and experiences.\n7. Community and Peer Support:\n├ö├ç├│ Community Forum: Integrate a community forum where individuals can share experiences, ask questions, and receive support from peers and mentors.\n├ö├ç├│ Virtual Events: Organize virtual events, workshops, and webinars focused on employment and career development, including special sessions for people with special needs.\nExpected Outcome: The system will facilitate a personalized job matching process and offer targeted skill development recommendations, helping job seekers become more competitive in the job market.\nNOTE : This is an innovation opportunity and students are encouraged to think out of the box to develop solutions which can be presented in newer ways + which can address the needs in out of the box ways for a certain industry OR makes the platform generic.

Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. \nCurrently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. \nDetailed Description: \nWith the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a \npressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an \nAI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc \nThis will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. \nExpected Solutions: \n1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. \n2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. \n3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ├ö├ç├ûs), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. \n4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it├ö├ç├ûs services based on these insights. \n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Government of Rajasthan </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Center for Electronic Governance </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Education</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Preparing a comprehensive and insightful annual report that accurately reflects the institute's accomplishments and growth is a complex and time-consuming task. It requires the aggregation, organization, analysis, and presentation of diverse data sources in a coherent and visually appealing manner.\nChallenge\nDesign and develop a user-friendly, efficient, and robust portal that streamlines the process of preparing the annual report for an educational institute. The portal should facilitate the collection, integration, analysis, and visualization of data from various departments and stakeholders within the institute. The goal is to create a dynamic, interactive, and automated system that minimizes manual effort, enhances accuracy, and provides valuable insights.\nKey Features and Requirements\nUser Authentication and Role Management:\nSecure login for different user roles (administrators, faculty, students, etc.).\nRole-based access control to ensure data privacy and security.\nData Collection and Integration:\nImport data from various sources (databases, spreadsheets, surveys, etc.).\nIntegration with existing systems (student management systems, financial software, research databases, etc.).\nSupport for manual data entry where necessary.\nData Analysis and Visualization:\nTools for analyzing academic performance, research output, financial data, and other metrics.\nCustomizable dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).\nGraphs, charts, and other visual aids for presenting data trends and insights.\nReport Generation:\nAutomated generation of the annual report in various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.).\nCustomizable templates for different sections of the report.\nInclusion of multimedia elements (images, videos, infographics).\nCollaboration and Feedback:\nFeatures for collaborative editing and review of report content.\nMechanisms for collecting feedback from stakeholders.\nVersion control to track changes and maintain document integrity.\nUser Experience:\nIntuitive and user-friendly interface.\nResponsive design for accessibility on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).\nMultilingual support for institutes with diverse language needs.\nCompliance and Standards:\nAdherence to relevant educational and reporting standards.\nData security and privacy compliance with regulations (GDPR, FERPA, etc.).\nExpected Outcomes\nParticipants are expected to deliver a functional prototype of the annual report preparation portal that demonstrates the core features and addresses the outlined requirements. The solution should be scalable, adaptable to different types of educational institutes, and capable of handling large volumes of data.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of AYUSH </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Education</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Coal mining is a major source of carbon emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. To achieve carbon neutrality, the Indian coal sector needs to offset its emissions. This can be done through a combination of strategies like reducing emissions from mining activities, adopting cleaner technologies, and offsetting remaining emissions by planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide. A web-based application can be a powerful tool in this journey by helping quantify a mine's carbon footprint and evaluate potential pathways to carbon neutrality.\nDescription: \nThe web based application will have following objectives:\nActivity wise quantification of Carbon emission in Coal Mines\nEstimation of existing Carbon Sinks\nGap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality\nExpected Solution:\nA comprehensive software solution that includes:\nEmission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors. Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine.\nCarbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like:\nClean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations.\nAfforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction.\nOther Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption.\nAny other pathways:\nCarbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates.\nData visualization: The app should present results visually, using charts and graphs to track emission trends and the effectiveness of implemented strategies.\nScalability: Design the app to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs open-cast).\nBenefits:\nTransparency: Providing a clear picture of a mine's carbon footprint.\nDecision support: Helping mine operators make informed choices for emission reduction.\nCost savings: Identifying opportunities to optimize operations and potentially reduce costs associated with emissions.\nSustainability goals: Aiding Indian coal mines in their journey towards carbon neutrality and supporting the country's overall climate goals.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Coal </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Central Mine Planning &amp; Design Institute Limited </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Renewable / Sustainable Energy</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal.\nDescription:\nThe problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines.\nA digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization.\nThe problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift├ö├ç├ûs activities.\nManual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life.\nDigitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.\nThis will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.\nEvery mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. \nAlso, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. \nPossible Solution:\nAn app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.\nAlso the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Coal </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Central Mine Planning &amp; Design Institute Limited </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

One prominent issue is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. Long queues are common, especially during peak hours, weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance, double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers.\nDescription:\nThe implementation of a chatbot for ticket booking in a museum addresses several critical needs, enhancing the overall visitor experience and streamlining museum operations. Here are the key reasons for adopting a chatbot ticket booking system:\n1. Improved Customer Service\n2. Efficient Handling of High Volumes\n3. Cost-Effective Solution\n4. Data Collection and Analysis\n5. Accessibility\n6. Reduced Human Error\n7. Multilingual Support\n8. Enhanced Marketing and Promotion\nExpected Solution:\nAn efficient and responsive multilingual chatbot based ticketing system that can handle all kinds of bookings from gate entry to shows. Payment gateway should also be integrated to make it fully free from human intervention. It will also provide analytics to aid in more efficient decision making process.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Culture </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Council of Science Museums </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Travel &amp; Tourism</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic.\nExploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks.\n\n├ö├ç├│ Description:\nThe most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further\ninvestigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.\nFollowing are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:\n1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range\n2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version\n3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint\n4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)\nThere are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.\nFor the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:\n1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.\n2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).\n3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).\n4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.\n5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.\nA solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.\n\nExpected Solution:\nA set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools\nshould be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack.

Climate change is increasing the number and size of glacial lakes, heightening the risk of GLOFs. Curent monitoring and prediction methods can be improved with advanced technologies like remote sensing, sensors installed near glacial lakes and machine learning.\n\n├ö├ç├│ Description: The aim is to develop a remote sensing and/or sensor-based Early Warning System (EWS) for GLOFs by utilizing remote sensing data, network of IoT sensors and advanced data analytics. The system will continuously monitor and identify critical changes in lake size, water level, temperature, sudden water flow, dam\nstability and ground movement etc. around glacial lakes. The machine learning algorithms will analyse the information to detect early signs of potential outbursts. This approach will significantly enhance the capability to predict and respond to GLOFs, improving safety, reducing economic losses, and contributing to resilient infrastructure planning in glacial regions.\n├ö├ç├│ Expected Solution:\nA Sensor which can be installed in glacial lake area, or a predictive model that significantly improves the Early Warning System ability for GLOFs, providing critical lead time for evacuation and mitigation efforts.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Defence </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Defence Research and Devlopment Organisation (DRDO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Disaster Management</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. \nDetailed description: \nThe automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. \nTo detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently.

Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.\nDetailed Description:\nConsidering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. \nData input, classification and arrangement \nThe software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.\nUsers, Data output and visualization\nThe users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.\n-In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.\nData Accessibility\nThe Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.\nExpected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Earth Sciences </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                Dummy Data sets will be provided during the grand fiNAle<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/Dummy Data sets will be provided during the grand fiNAle\">Dummy Data sets will be provided during the grand fiNAle<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.\nDescription: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship├ö├ç├ûs motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.\nDescription: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.\nThe DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.\nIf a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.\nThis system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.\nExpected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Earth Sciences </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                Sample datasets can be downloaded from the following links.\n Sea surface temperature data: https://search.earthdata.NAsa.gov/search?q=SEVIRI_IO_SST-OSISAF-L3C-v1.0\n Sea surface height data:\n https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L3_NRT_008_044/\n Coupled Model Intercomparison Project:\n https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/cmip5/data/cmip5/ou<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/Sample datasets can be downloaded from the following links.\n Sea surface temperature data: https://search.earthdata.NAsa.gov/search?q=SEVIRI_IO_SST-OSISAF-L3C-v1.0\n Sea surface height data:\n https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L3_NRT_008_044/\n Coupled Model Intercomparison Project:\n https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/cmip5/data/cmip5/ou\">Sample datasets can be downloaded from the following links.\n Sea surface temperature data: https://search.earthdata.NAsa.gov/search?q=SEVIRI_IO_SST-OSISAF-L3C-v1.0\n Sea surface height data:\n https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L3_NRT_008_044/\n Coupled Model Intercomparison Project:\n https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/cmip5/data/cmip5/ou<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity├ö├ç├ûs relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).\n\nDescription: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.\n\nExpected Solution:\nThe user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.\nThe solution should be suitable for windows and android environments (web and browser based) and scalable over the time by the host institute independently post-SIH</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Earth Sciences </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                Ocean advisory and information services may be accessed from https://incois.gov.in/<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/Ocean advisory and information services may be accessed from https://incois.gov.in/\">Ocean advisory and information services may be accessed from https://incois.gov.in/<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

In India, many students and their families are unaware of the diverse career opportunities available, often leading to choices based on limited information or societal pressure. Effective career counselling and guidance are essential for helping students make informed decisions about their futures and aligning their education with their career aspirations. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the need for holistic education, which includes providing students with the guidance necessary to make informed career choices.\nDescription: The proposed solution focuses on implementing comprehensive career counselling and guidance programs in schools. This includes training career counsellors, developing resources and tools for career exploration, and integrating career guidance into the school curriculum. Programs should provide personalized counselling sessions, workshops, and access to information on various career paths and educational requirements. Additionally, leveraging technology to create interactive platforms for career exploration can enhance student engagement and awareness. These initiatives align with NEP 2020's vision of equipping students with the knowledge and skills to pursue their career aspirations.\nInnovative Solutions:\na) AI-Powered Career Guidance Platforms: Develop AI-driven platforms that provide personalized career advice based on students' interests, strengths, and market trends.\nb) Career Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs where students can receive guidance and support from professionals in their fields of interest.\nc) Interactive Career Exploration Tools: Create digital tools and apps that allow students to explore different careers through virtual simulations, videos, and interactive content.\nd) Comprehensive Career Resource Portals: Develop online portals with extensive resources on career options, required skills, educational pathways, and job market trends.\nBy implementing these innovative solutions, we aim to improve career counselling and guidance in schools, helping students make informed career choices that align with their interests and the demands of the job market. This approach supports NEP 2020's goal of providing holistic and relevant education to all students.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Education </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, Department of School Education &amp; Literacy (DoSEL) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Education</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

While vocational education programs exist, they are often undervalued compared to traditional academic paths and need enhancement to provide students with the skills demanded by today├ö├ç├ûs job market. Strengthening vocational education is essential for creating a skilled workforce that aligns with industry needs and supports sustainable economic growth. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the importance of vocational education and aims to integrate it into the mainstream education system to prepare students for various career paths.\nDescription: The goal is to transform vocational education into a core component of the elementary and secondary education system, as envisioned in NEP 2020. By collaborating with industry experts, we can design a curriculum that is modern and industry-relevant. Investments in infrastructure will ensure schools have the necessary tools and facilities for effective training. Specialized training programs for educators will enhance the quality of vocational teaching. Partnerships with industries will offer students valuable real-world experience through internships and apprenticeships.

Users of these digital facilities are required to upload government-issued containing documents or provide data for successfully availing the services. However, the uploaded documents or data which are required to facilitate these digital services and processes contain personally identifiable information (PII), i.e. any data that can be used to identify an individual uniquely. These documents can be like Aadhaar card, PAN, Credit Card, Driving License etc and can include data like names, address, phone number, email address, and financial information, among others of the user. The handling of PII is crucial as its exposure can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud among other cyber related issues.\nDetailed Description:\nThe above problem statement envisages that an application be developed to identify whether PII, in the form of government-issued documents such as Aadhaar, Driving license, MHA-issued ID Cards, etc. is embedded in the uploaded document or provided data. Notable, the PII may be included inadvertently as well. PII, by its nature, is sensitive data, and its exposure must be protected against in order to safeguard users├ö├ç├û privacy. Entities and organizations handling documents or data containing users├ö├ç├û PII must be mindful of the complex challenges that arise with it ├ö├ç├┤ they have to balance data storage, encryption, access controls, data retention policies, data management processes with users├ö├ç├û knowledge and consent, notification of breaches by users, grievance redressal, etc. Such an application will aid in alerting individual users to verify whether it is necessary to upload or provide PII-containing document. Simultaneously, it will allow the personal data processing entity to check whether such PII document or data is required, and in case not necessary, help in removing, redacting or masking the PII\ndocument or data from the uploaded or provided document or alerting the individual user regarding the same. This application would be useful for the purposes of data protection compliance, risk mitigation, enhanced security, improved data quality, operational efficiency, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nExpected Solution:\nA software application or library package to detect and alert users when there is personally identifiable information (PII) related to identified government-issued identification documents (Aadhaar card, PAN, Driving License to start with) embedded in the uploaded documents or providing data, while uploading or reviewing. In addition, the software application may be placed in public domain and shall allow the receiver of the document in removing, redacting or masking the PII from the document and data, if required.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Co-ordination Division </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

However, a significant challenge arises when dealing with non-machine-readable documents such as PDFs or Word documents. These formats hinder automation and make it difficult to extract meaningful insights from the data they contain. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a solution that can both restrict the ingestion of non-machine-readable documents and facilitate the creation of machine-readable documents seamlessly.\nDescription:\nThe above problem statement envisages:\n1. To develop an application that can restrict software applications from ingesting any non-machine-readable document format such as PDFs, DOCs, or any other document types.\n2. To create a mechanism within the application to generate machine-readable documents automatically whenever a new document is created, regardless of its source - scanned, generated through a software application, or otherwise.\nExpected Solution:\nThe TransformoDocs application aims to address the challenges associated with managing non-machine-readable documents by developing a comprehensive document transformation application. It will help in realizing the benefits of search-ability, artificial intelligence, accessibility to persons with disability, machine translation and access to data across applications and data exchanges. This application may offer efficient data extraction, standardized processing, workflow automation, data quality improvement, scalability, integration with external systems, advanced analytics, and compliance with regulatory requirements ultimately unlocking the value of their data.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Co-ordination Division </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Background. UIDAI is exploring possibilities to enable Face authentication on the desktop in a browser context. The proposed architecture to provide Face\nAuthentication in the browser context,requires AI on the edge to perform liveness check of the face being captured by the webcam or connected camera. UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism.\nThe security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and\nreverse engineering.\n2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or\ncryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated.\nTo solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the\nbrowser context.\nThe proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives.\n1 Model Security. The solution must provide a mechanism to protect the model from any reverse engineering or tampering.\n2 Model Size Optimisation. The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are\nexpected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience.\n3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time\ntask during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach.

The proposed solution must meet the following objectives.\n\n3.1 Feature Requirements. The solution must define the list of environmental parameters that need to be captured to differentiate between a bot and a human being. If passive parameter analysis is unable to differentiate, then\nthe user may be asked to do a few minimal interactions with the portal. User experience is important to UIDAI and hence human interaction is to be limited.\n3.2 Frontend code to capture environmental or human interaction data must be compliant with the javascript framework. Participating teams may choose to use any framework like React/TypeScript/Flutter to demonstrate the solution.\n3.3 As part of the solution, the required backend ML model to analyze the front- end capture of environment parameters or human interaction data must be developed to demonstrate the solution. The ML model must be pluggable so that it can be integrated with the UIDAI application stack to protect the APIs.\n3.4 The solution must adhere to the core privacy policies of UIDAI.\n5.

This\n portal enables farmers to use their smartphones to access diagnostic tools, report\n symptoms, and receive actionable advice. Al algorithms can analyze reported data to\n provide accurate diagnoses and suggest appropriate treatments or interventions. This\n technology can empower farmers with the knowledge and tools to manage diseases\n more effectively, ensuring the health and productivity of their farms.\n lntegrate Al-based software with existing NDLM to allow farmers to submit images and\n descriptions of disease signs and symptoms. The Al will generate suspected\n disease/condition reports with preventive measures and send alerts to veterinarians for\n appropriate action (Al-based software, Mobile application).\n Expected Outcomes\n . Enhanced Disease Diagnosis:\n . Timely Reporting and lntervention:\n . lncreased Access to Expert Knowledge:\n . lmproved Farm Productivity. Data Collection and Analysis:\n Cost-Effective DiseaseManagement:\n Empowerment and Education of Farmers:\n lntegration with Existing Surveillance Systems\n . Community Engagement and Support:\n Sustainable Agriculture Practices</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Animal Husbandry &amp; Dairying </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Agriculture, FoodTech &amp; Rural Development</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Channels operating on Telegram and WhatsApp and Instagram handles are blatantly being misused by drug traffickers for offering various narcotic drugs and Psychotropic substances for sale.\nDescription: WhatsApp and Telegram channels and Instagram handles are created by drug traffickers to offer various drugs for sale to their subscribers. Customized\nTelegram bots are also created by some of the drug traffickers to sell drugs. It is most worrisome that majority of the drugs which are being offered on sale through Telegram, WhatsApp and Instagram are dangerous synthetic drugs like MDMA, LSD, Mephedrone etc. The above three apps are also used by drug traffickers for drug communication.\nExpected Solution: Development of a software solution to identify live Telegram and WhatsApp channels/bots and Instagram handles that are offering drugs for sale in India. Solution also should focus on triangulating identifiable parameters like IP address, mobile number, email id etc of the users behind the channel/bot/handle.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The relative anonymity and speed provided by cryptocurrencies are misused by drug traffickers as a mode of transaction for drug sales and also as an asset to amass the proceeds of crime.\nDescription: Drug traffickers operating on darknet and elsewhere on internet enabled platforms like social media apps, messaging services etc receive the value of drugs through cryptocurrencies. In a few cases, the drug traffickers save their proceeds of crime in cryptocurrencies. During the course of investigations and also through intelligence, wallet addresses and transactions hash related to drug transactions are obtained by Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Further, it has also been observed that these finds are often passed through variety of services like tumblers, mixers, bridges etc to further anonymize the transactions.

These devices/application come with vulnerabilities from time to time. There should be timely information sharing mechanism by which the concerned equipment users at critical sector orgs should be altered regarding any critical / high severity vulnerabilities in their equipment within the shortest possible time.\n Detailed description:\n The ICT components (HW/SW) being used by Critical Sector Organisations become vulnerable from time to time. These vulnerabilities can be categorised as Critical, High, Medium and Low. Any exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause havoc in multiple Critical Sector Organisations where such vulnerable equipment are being used.\n Keeping in view of the above, there is a need to monitor all such vulnerability information published at the equipment├ö├ç├ûs OEM websites and also other relevant websites. Once a critical or high severity vulnerability information is published at OEM website or any other relevant website, the ├ö├ç├┐to be developed scrapper├ö├ç├û will immediately take that vulnerability input along with possible mitigating strategy published in the website and send the information to predefined email id(s).\n Note: The NVD website publishes such OEM vulnerable information. But the same comes with a time lag. It is therefore needed to get such information directly from OEM websites and /or from other relevant websites where such vulnerable information is published almost in real time.\n Expected Outcome:\n An automatic script using open source tools to be developed for the OEM vulnerability information scrapping and reporting. Tool should know various vulnerability information published data formats/syntax at OEM websites (both for IT and OT hardware and application) and come up with optimum solution for monitoring and reporting of such vulnerability information.\n \n The output of the tool that will be emailed to pre-designated email id(s) is as per following (shared with example; all fields may not be available at the time of reporting):\n * Product Name: Chrome\n * Product Version: - NA\n * OEM name: Google\n * Severity Level (Critical/High): High\n * Vulnerability: The N-able PassPortal extension before 3.29.2 for Chrome inserts sensitive information into a log file.\n * Mitigation Strategy: Install patch from https://me.n-able.com/s/security-advisory/aArHs000000M8CCKA0/cve202347131-passportal-browser-extension-logs-sensitive-data\n * Published Date: Jan 2024\n * Unique ID: CVE-2023-47131</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

This empowers them to take necessary actions to mitigate further risk.\nDescription:\nIn order to achieve objective of protecting Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIs) of the Nation, it is very vital to have real time information related to cyber threats and incidents specific to Indian Cyber space. This may enhance the Threat Assessment potential based on the incidents that have already happened or the ones that currently exists. Therefore, a framework to crawl/scrap/collect the cyber incident activities reported anywhere on the web related to Indian cyber space is required to be developed.\nExpected Solution:\n1. Using Machine Learning, find platforms that publish or works as intermediate platform for sharing cyber incident activities related to cyber incidents.\n2. Design a model framework for the cyber incidents feed generator which collects data from various forums, paste sites, social media, developer or any other platforms as identified by Machine learning model generated in accordance to point 1 above.\n3. Creation of well-structured database of cyber incidents extracted by framework developed in accordance with point 2 above.\n4. Generation of valuable insights from the data collected and its visual representation of cyber incidents specific to sectors, APTs and strategic issues.\nNote: Students are encouraged not to use paid APIs for solving the problem.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.\nDescription: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.\nThe degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.\nIt is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.\nDeclassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.\nExpected Solution:\nProblem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool ├ö├ç┬úRE-DACT├ö├ç├ÿ which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output. Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.\nStage 1\nData: Curate and use own data set for building PoC\nTask/Result: Input/Output: Supports common input formats (text files, images) and basic output formats (redacted files, logs).

Compliance with industry standard bench marks and guidelines, such as those provided by Center for Internet Security (CIS), is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of their IT Infrastructure. However, manually auditing and ensuring adherence to these benchmarks and guidelines can be time- consuming, error prone, and resource intensive. Current practises often involve manual checks. To address these challenges, there is a critical need to develop automated auditing scripts tailored to CIS benchmarks.\nDetailed description:\nThis software solution aimed to list out the control guidelines as per CIS benchmark for the following operating systems: -\nWindows (Reference\nwww.cisecurity.org/benchmark/Microsoft_winodws_desktop)\ni. Windows 11 (Enterprise version)\nii. Windows 11 (Standalone version)\nLinux (Reference:www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/red_hat_linux, www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux)\ni. Redhat Enterprise (8 and 9)\nii. Ubuntu desktop (20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS)\niii. Ubuntu server (12.04LTS and 14.04 LTS)\nPreferable scripting language (PowerShell for Windows, bash/python for Linux).\nExpected solution:\ni. A user-friendly GUI based solution with capability to generate a report of findings.\nii. Should be customizable as per organizational needs and scale to audit large and diverse IT environments effectively.\niii. Scripts should be reliable and accurate in identifying the deviations from\niv. best practices outlined in CIS benchmarks.\nv. Should facilitate easy update and maintenance to accommodate changes in benchmarks over time.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The system to be able to function at high performance when very few (Few Shot) examples per keyword are given for training. The key features of the system would be as mentioned below: -\n(a) The system should be language agnostic\n(b) The system should be able to handle audio files at various sample\nrates (8k-48k).\n(c) The system should be able to upgrade to additional keywords.\nPerformance Criteria: For creating a system with Few Shot capabilities, the participants may need to do pre-training of their model on a large corpus. This corpus should be obtained by the participants themselves. We will provide few examples per keyword at the training time during the conduct of the hackathon. The participants will be judged on a separate test set having the same keywords as the train set. The performance would be ascertained on the following:\n(a) Metric\n(b) Latency and throughput of the responses.\n(c) Smaller model size.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.\n2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.\n2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ├ö├ç├┐price reasonability├ö├ç├û for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.\n2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.\n2.2 Detailed Description:\n2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:\ni. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.\nii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.\niii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.\n2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.\n2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).\n\n2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.\n2.3 Expected Solution:\n2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.\n2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services.\n2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.\n(Drive link for further explanation of the expected solution : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAwvekZ54TZpntQUnGdVF6gBvGk_NbIu/view?usp=sharing)\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation├ö├ç├ûs politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed.\nDetailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: \ni.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. \nii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. \niii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. \niv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. \nv.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. \nvi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. \nvii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. \nviii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. \nix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. \nExpected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation. \n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                The world leader├ö├ç├ûs dataset (WLDR), The FaceForensics++ dataset (FF), The DeepFake Detection dataset (DFD), The Deep Fake Detection Challenge Preview dataset (DFDC-P), The Celeb-DF etc.<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/The world leader├ö├ç├ûs dataset (WLDR), The FaceForensics++ dataset (FF), The DeepFake Detection dataset (DFD), The Deep Fake Detection Challenge Preview dataset (DFDC-P), The Celeb-DF etc.\">The world leader├ö├ç├ûs dataset (WLDR), The FaceForensics++ dataset (FF), The DeepFake Detection dataset (DFD), The Deep Fake Detection Challenge Preview dataset (DFDC-P), The Celeb-DF etc.<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

In addition, one important requirement of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) is that solution should be ├ö├ç┬úoffline and on-premise├ö├ç├ÿ and should be ├ö├ç┬úupdated with latest definition on regular basis├ö├ç├ÿ. Therefore, the reliable and effective solution can be developed by creating a pipeline combining multiple AV engines working parallelly offline. \nDescription: To develop a scanning pipeline in which the data residing in ├ö├ç┬úTarget Folder├ö├ç├ÿ will be scanned automatically by multiple antiviruses and accordingly the cleaned files will be in same folder and the infected files will be segregated and transferred in a specific folder i.e. ├ö├ç┬úInfected Folders├ö├ç├ÿ with their analysis report. In addition, the path of each infected file will also be recorded in a separate doc file in same Infected folders.\nThe functional block diagram is depicted below: \nTarget Folder -&gt; Offline Parallel -&gt; Infected Files\nOne VM may be used for one AV which will be updated regularly (as per respective AV update policy) with latest definition of respective AV. The free/trail version of AVs can be used for building and testing the features of parallel AV pipeline. Atleast following three AVs should be included in AV pipeline: \n1. Window Defender \n2. Trend Micro Maximum Security \n3. Eset Internet Security \nExpected Solution: The details of expected outcomes are given below: \n(a). Raw Data will be kept at ├ö├ç┬úTarget folder├ö├ç├ÿ and available multiple antiviruses should recognize the presence of data and start scanning automatically. \n(b). Cleaned file will be in same folders and Infected files &amp; its Analysis Report should be move to a dedicated defined ├ö├ç┬úInfected folder├ö├ç├ÿ. The path of each infected file will also be recorded in one doc file.\n(c). The scanning process shall be continued till all infected files are segregated. After successful completion by multiple AVs, a popup message of ├ö├ç┬úScanning Completed├ö├ç├ÿ should be displayed. The solution should have dashboard like VirusTotal where the results with each AV should be displayed. \n(d). The scanning shall be started simultaneously by all the multiple AVs (Parallel Processing) for efficient processing.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides detailed guidelines and benchmarks for securing various operating systems, including Windows 10 and 11. Implementing CIS benchmarks through\ncustomized GPOs ensures that systems adhere to industry best hardening practices, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing overall security posture.\nDetailed Description :\na) Deploying customized GPOs, based on CIS guidelines or user requirements is essential for hardening Windows systems. It will help in ensuring robust security and maintaining compliance with industry standards. \n(b) The guidelines contain multiple system configurations in terms of registry settings and group policy settings. Deploying of these settings as per user requirement is a daunting task, considering the availability of limited tools and human-intensive efforts. \n(c) Present problem statement is an attempt to explore the possible tools and techniques to automate the task of generating and managing the GPOs as per user requirements for various types of systems including airgapped/standalone machine.\nExpected Solution: Following functionalities have been envisaged for the expected solution: - \n(a) To create, edit and manage GPOs as per CIS guidelines and user requirements, if needed. \n(b) The customised GPOs generated should be deployable on airgapped / standalone system. \n(c) To maintain multiple group / category of system hardening settings with appropriate documentation to define the configuration details for each of the group / category. \n(d) Import / Export of configuration details for catering to user requirement to maintain multiple group / category of system configurations. \n(e) Tool should be able to import documentation from CIS guidelines available in PDF format. \n(f) Envisaged tool should support in deploying GPOs on the target machine. \n(g) Envisaged tool should support in testing and auditing of system configurations on the target machine\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_desktop<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_desktop\">https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_desktop<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Social media platforms serve as a valuable repository of such data, but manually monitoring and sorting through the vast amount of information is inefficient and resource-intensive.\nDescription: There is a pressing need for a software solution that can efficiently aggregate and categorize specific disaster-related data from social media, news portals, and other open sources. This software would utilize advanced algorithms to sift through the abundance of information and classify it into different categories data would then be presented on a user- friendly dashboard, allowing disaster response agencies to quickly access relevant information and plan their actions accordingly.\nExpected Solutions: The software solutions will streamline the process of gathering and categorizing disaster-related data from various soucres, significantly reducing the time required for response efforts. By providing real-time insights and actionable information, the software will enhance the effectiveness of disaster response operations, ultimately saving lives.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), MHA </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National disaster response force (NDRF) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Disaster Management</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The water footprint helps us understand for what purposes our limited freshwater resources are being consumed. The impact of it depends on where the water is taken from and when, if it comes from a place where water is already scarce, the consequences can be significant and require action. \nDetailed Description \nThe increase in the amount of non-available water due to pollution and scarce groundwater level has added more water footprints, at the community as well as at the personal levels. An increased \nÔö¼├Ç water footprint directly affects the health and future of the citizens. Preventing severe drought in water-stressed areas is only going to be possible if water is used with more care and efficiency, this can be achieved if we have readily available data of water footprints. \nExpected Solution \nHence, by using digital technologies like AI, Big Data, Block chain etc. and computer languages, a user friendly app or website may be developed which can provide the water footprints of different items/ final products we eat by feeding little inputs like name, or just by scanning through camera like Google lens. The app should support local languages; this will ensure the pan India usage and sensitize the people about water footprints of items they use in daily life.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Despite the existence of various methods to conserve water, especially in agriculture, the lack of awareness and accessibility to this information perpetuates inefficient water use. This gap in knowledge sharing contributes to the overuse of water resources and exacerbates water stress, particularly in regions where agriculture is heavily dependent on irrigation. Establishing a comprehensive, accessible platform could catalyze the adoption of sustainable practices, crucial for addressing the global challenge of water scarcity. \nDetailed Description: \nA centralized knowledge-sharing platform akin to Wikis would facilitate the exchange of innovative methods, successful case studies, and research findings, fostering local and global collaboration. Without it, valuable insights remain siloed, hindering the adoption of practices that could conserve water resources and enhance sustainability. The creation of an accessible, comprehensive repository of water conservation strategies is thus critical for addressing the pressing challenge of water scarcity worldwide. \nExpected Solution: \nTo address the lack of knowledge sharing platforms on water efficiency, creating a dedicated wiki-style database is the key. This platform would host peer-reviewed articles on water-saving techniques, community forums for sharing local knowledge, videos and interactive tools for calculating water usage and savings. Additionally, integrating social media sharing can amplify reach and engagement, while mobile app development ensures accessibility for users in remote areas, contributing significantly to the reduction of water scarcity globally.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

However, due to increasing population, change in extreme climatic conditions, improvement in agricultural practices there is a necessity for re-evaluation of the current infrastructure and water management practices. \nDescription \nIt is likely that existing dams get silted up over time and are unable to store sufficient water. Due to which there will be a shift in the command area or the cropping pattern. It is also a known fact that changing climate issues is also posing a problem, due to which there is need to review the agricultural requirement. The existing dams and reservoirs are increasingly vulnerable to the adverse climate change and shifts in agricultural practices. These changes can lead to structural stress, altered water availability and inefficiencies in water distribution and usage. There is an urgent need to develop and implement new monitoring and water management models to ensure the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of these critical infrastructures. \nExpected Solution \nThis problem will address the safety and resilience of dams and reservoirs against climate - induced risks, enhance water resources management and optimally support the agricultural needs and environmental sustainability. There will also be a long-term planning of water \ninfrastructure in the face of climate and agricultural changes. \nThis needs work on the Hydrological impact due to changes in the climatic conditions, which in turn effect the water demand in the command area. The changing technology, and adaption of new agricultural practices should be taken into account. It is essential to implement a decision support system along with predictive analysis that provide insights to the water managers and policy makers on real-time data.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. \nDescription \nThere is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. \nExpected Solution \nThere is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies.\nAs pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.\nDescription: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological &amp; hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.\nModel source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.\nThe overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.\nExpected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological &amp; hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.\na. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.\nb. Dashboard may show the following options \ni. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc.\nii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days.\n2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system.\n3.

CGWB will be monitoring 14,000 DWLRs by 2026, which will generate high-frequency water level measurements. Each DWLR will record 4 ground water level data per day, generating 1460 measurements per year. \nAnalysing all the 14,000 wells will be an enormous task. Accordingly, a software application is proposed to analyse and flag anomalous data. Input to the application will be high frequency water level data collected through the telemetry systems. The application should be able to identify DWLRs recording no data/abnormal data or DWLRs with low battery level. The application will raise alarms and send messages to the concerned officer and vendors to initiate immediate action.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Long term groundwater level data acquired through regular monitoring of groundwater levels provide an opportunity to understand the behavior of the aquifers to changing stress regime. Central Ground Water Board periodically monitors ground water levels from nearly 26000 wells. CGWB is also in the process of installing Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLRs) across various parts of Indiaeach capturing and transmitting water level data four times per day. In addition to CGWB there are many other agencies measuring water levels. \nThe software application is expected to analyse groundwater levels and factors impacting groundwater level like rainfall, hydrogeology, landuse, population, surface elevation, natural features, tidal cycles etc. Based on these factors and based on observed water level data, the software application should be able to predict and forecast groundwater levels both in space and time. The application will be accessible to all for predicting groundwater level at any place at any point on time. This will also help in filling data gaps in time-series data.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of WR, RD &amp; GR </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Internet/mobile based games could be one of the best ways to lure school kids, youth and water enthusiasts to learn the nuances of ground water management. With this backdrop it is proposed to develop an internet/mobile based game that teaches good practices in groundwater conservation in an interactive and fun way. The game should take into account various interventions (artificial recharge, microirrigation, crop diversification) and possible scenarios (drought, surplus rain, contamination etc). The gamer can earn points or coins based on the choices that he (or she) makes. The scores of registered gamers will be stored online and water-smart youths can be identified and certified.

Over the years, various legislative and policy reforms have been undertaken by the Government of India with the active support of the judiciary to strengthen the commercial\ndispute resolution machinery in the country. However, expediting the resolution of commercial disputes without addressing the broader issue of huge pendency in courts is unlikely to be successful. Accordingly, it is proposed to leverage the use of technology for expediting the process of dispute resolution.\n? Description: A solution is invited to develop an AI-Driven Research Engine exclusively for commercial courts thereby easing the legal research process for judges and judicial officers ultimately contributing to faster dispute resolution.\no Role: The Research Engine must aggregate and process legal data sources, including case laws, statutory provisions, rules, etc. After aggregation and processing of data, it must extract relevant information, identify key legal principles, precedents, etc. and furnish results.\no Customization: The Research Engine must provide results in a customized manner i.e. as per the needs and demands of each commercial suit.\no Use of Predictive Analytics: The Research Engine must be capable of forecasting case outcomes based on historical trends and patterns.\no Data Localization: The Research Engine must ensure that the results meet the diverse requirements of different High Courts of the country and that adequate emphasis is laid on local laws, rules and procedures.\no Feasibility: The solution must be technically feasible as per the requirements of the Indian Judicial System.\no Reliability: The Research Engine must ensure that the results are relevant and reliable.\no User-Friendly: The Research Engine must be user-friendly.\no Multilingual: The Research Engine must ensure that it supports multiple languages.\no Ethical Concerns: Giving primacy to ethical concerns surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, measures must be taken to ensure that the engine works in a neutral and transparent manner as a ├ö├ç├┐facilitator├ö├ç├û and not a ├ö├ç├┐decision-maker├ö├ç├û.\n? Expected Solution: Development of an ├ö├ç┬úArtificial Intelligence-Driven Research Engine for Commercial Courts├ö├ç├ÿ that may be considered for a pilot project for reforms associated with commercial courts with the ultimate objective of ease of doing business in India. The solution is expected to assist in expediting legal research and streamlining judicial processes.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Law and Justice </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Law and Justice </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The Bail Reckoner aims to simplify and expedite the bail application and evaluation process by considering various legal and procedural parameters.\nParameters to Consider for integration in the Tool:\n1. Nature of the Offense and Penal Provisions:\no Seek the inputs for the charges framed (can be multiple charges, and if they are compoundable etc). In this regard Statutes like Indian Penal Code,1860 and the upcoming Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023; Bhartiya Suraksha Sanhita 2023; and Bhartiya Saakshya Adhiniyam 2023; should be covered. Special statutes on the following under-mentioned areas should also be covered:\n1. Cyber Crimes\n2. Crimes Against SCs and STs:\n3. Crimes Against Women\n4. Crimes Against Children\n5. Offences Against the State\n6. Economic Offence\n7. Crimes Against Foreigners\na. Develop a comprehensive backend database to map penalties with sections of various Acts/Laws.\nb. Link and provide detailed information on the nature of offenses and corresponding legal provisions.\n2. Duration of Imprisonment Already Served:\na. Track the duration of imprisonment undertrial prisoner has served.\nb. Highlight the eligibility timeline for bail based on the time already served.\n3. Considerations of Judge├ö├ç├ûs Discretion:\na. Evaluate the risk of the undertrial prisoner escaping the judicial process, such as leaving the country.\nb. Assess the potential influence the prisoner may have on evidence or witnesses.\n4. Procedural Pre-requisites:\na. Outline requirements such as surety bonds, personal bonds, fines (if applicable), and identity verification.\nb. Ensure compliance with procedural aspects under IPC/CrPC.\n5. Judicial Pronouncements on Bail Eligibility:\na. Integrate key judicial pronouncements regarding bail eligibility.\nb. Automatically identify undertrial prisoners who are eligible for bail if they have served half the term during the undertrial stage, based on the prescribed sentence for their charges.\nSolution Requirements\n. The Bail Reckoner should be a user-friendly, plug-and-play tool that can be integrated into existing software systems. It must provide a clear and accessible interface for:\n1. Undertrial Prisoners: To understand their eligibility and process for applying for bail.\n2. Legal Aid Providers: To assist in preparing and submitting accurate bail applications.\n3. Judicial Authorities: To streamline the evaluation process and ensure timely decisions.\nBy leveraging technology and innovation, the Bail Reckoner aims to make the bail process more transparent, efficient, and just, contributing to a more equitable legal system.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Law and Justice </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Law and Justice </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Article 243G of the Constitution of India acknowledges Panchayats as institutions of local self-government and mandates them to prepare plans for economic development and social justice. As local government, Gram Panchayats (GPs) are responsible for delivery of basic services to local citizens and address the vulnerabilities of poor and marginalized ones. This can only be achieved through implementation of well thought out\nplans through efficient and responsible utilization of available resources.\n2. An efficient and robust planning process as part of GP├ö├ç├ûs core functioning becomes necessary. GP development plan should ideally match people├ö├ç├ûs needs and priorities with the available resources. It should be prepared through a fair, inclusive, transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local development issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of problems and solutions, and local resources management all within a collective local vision.\n3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for effective implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National importance.\nThe formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution.\n4. A need was felt to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile, i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part IX areas.\nAccordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating 17 SDGs into 9 broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) at grassroot level through Panchayats adopting ├ö├ç├┐Whole of Government and Whole of Society Approach├ö├ç├û and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic approach to achieve localization for SDGs in rural India.\n\n29 Subjects defined in the Eleventh Schedule\n1.

A simulated environment is needed to develop a self-sustained village development plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the\n\nvillage using the resources available. It is envisaged to develop ├ö├ç├┐Farmville├ö├ç├û kind of a game for a village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input.\nKey Components to include for the game app:\nBudget Estimate: Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning.\nWork Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction, establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc.\nThe basic steps of the Game broadly involve: -\ni. Select the village, where development plan is required by the villagers.\nii. Based on the input received such as the village building footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing village for which development plan is required.\niii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the village.\niv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying of\ndrainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the villagers, etc.\nv. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats under different Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the development activity\nas in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats.\nvi. Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features.\nvii. Arrive at a tentative estimate for the planning being performed.\nviii. Ability to provide a walkthrough of the 3D platform.\nix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D platform.\nA few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: -\nCase1: Road laying activity\n\n├ö├ç├│ The player selects the start point and endpoint with intermediate points wherever required for road construction. It needs to validate that any road laying activity may not be a duplicate road construction plan.\n├ö├ç├│ The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of the road etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game. Based on\nchanging the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road, it should be regenerated.\n├ö├ç├│ Once the road construction is done by the player, cost of construction should be auto generated.\n├ö├ç├│ Ability to measure the road dimensions and road shoulders.\n\nCase 2: Streetlight\n\n├ö├ç├│ The player selects the road where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game artefacts.\n├ö├ç├│ The player has option to check the light illumination based on the time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change ├ö├ç├┤ the changes to reflect on the game for best results.\n├ö├ç├│ Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street lighting to be generated.\n\nCase 3: Ability to measure the building height and width of each side.\n\n├ö├ç├│ The player selects the village for developmental activity.\n├ö├ç├│ The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected village.\n├ö├ç├│ The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create the dimension of the house along with roof type area.\n\nExpected Solution\nPanchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times, exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan to\ndevelop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat development plan activities.\n├ö├ç├│ A detailed game outlining the work model.\n├ö├ç├│ Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface.\n├ö├ç├│ Documentation on implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the gamification system into the Hackathon event.\n1.

The Hon├ö├ç├ûble Prime Minister launched the SVAMITVA Scheme on the National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2020 with a resolve to enable the economic progress of Rural India by providing ├ö├ç┬úRecord of Rights├ö├ç├ÿ to every rural household owner. The scheme aims to demarcate inhabited (Abadi) land in rural areas through the latest surveying drone technology, Continuous Operating Reference System (CORS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loan; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning\n2. With the use latest drone technology and CORS technology for the Abadi land survey, the high resolution and accurate image base maps of 50 cm have facilitated creation of the most durable record of property holdings in these areas with no legacy revenue records. Such accurate image-based maps provide a clear demarcation of land holdings in a very short frame of time compared to on ground physical measurement and mapping of the land parcels.\nDescription\ni. Develop an AI model capable of identifying key features in orthophotos with high precision: Use of AI/ML techniques for extraction of the following features from SVAMITVA Drone Imagery using a cloud-based solution: -\na. Building footprint extraction (built-up area from the drone image and classified roof-top based on observation on the imagery as RCC, Tiled, Tin, and Others. These built up area can be used for various service such as solar energy calculation, property tax calculation, etc.)\nb. Road feature extraction\nc. Waterbodies extraction, etc\nii. Achieve a target accuracy of 95% in feature identification.\niii. Optimize the model for efficient processing and deployment.\n\nThe broad scope of work includes:-\ni. Data Preparation: Utilize the SVAMITVA Scheme drone-labeled datasets for 10 villages to train and validate the AI model.\nii. Model Development: Employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other suitable AI/ML models for image segmentation and feature identification.\niii. Model Training: Efficient training of the model ensures it learns to identify the desired features accurately.\niv. Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model to achieve the target accuracy of 95%, optimizing for speed and resource utilization.\nv. Testing and Validation: Rigorously test the model on a separate dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability.\nvi.

With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.\nProblem Statement Details:\n├ö├ç┬úDevelop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.├ö├ç├ÿ\nNOTE : GAIL (INDIA) LTD will not provide any hardware, software, license, data or any other resource to SIH hackathon Teams.

This process involves verification of numerous documents such as birth certificates, academic transcripts, identification cards, and experience certificates. There is a pressing need for an online solution that automates and secures the document verification process.\n\nDescription: This problem statement addresses the urgent requirement for an online platform, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, to automate document verification for all official purposes. The proposed solution aims to establish a user-friendly portal accessible to issuing authorities (e.g., schools, universities, employers), verifying authorities (government offices, banks, legal entities), and individuals. Issuing authorities will generate digital certificates for individuals, including birth certificates, academic transcripts, and experience certificates. These certificates will be securely stored on the blockchain for tamper-proof authenticity. Individuals will have access to the portal to view all documents issued in their name.\n\nExpected Solution: Participants are tasked with developing a comprehensive portal that facilitates the generation, verification, and accessibility of essential documents for any official purpose. The platform should utilize Al algorithms to efficiently verify the authenticity of uploaded documents. Verifying authorities will have access to a secure interface to validate submitted documents against predefined criteria. Individuals will be able to access the portal to view all documents issued to their name. The implementation of blockchain technology will ensure the immutability and integrity of the verified certificates. Ultimately, the solution aims to streamline the document verification process, reducing time and resources required for all stakeholders involved in official documentation.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Power </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The therapist then prepares therapy plan with goals and activities. The respective case supervisor needs to check the therapy plan and provide the inputs for further continuation of regular therapy sessions. At least post ten therapy sessions the therapist writes the progress report of the therapy case. Further, it is evaluated by the supervisor. This Cycle of speech language therapy clinical services in continuous until the therapy case has completely improved or discontinued due to various reasons. The supervisor based on overall handling of therapy sessions gives clinical ratings.\nExpected Solution: The process needs to become digitized with the use of software where in right from the allocation of cases, therapy related documentation by both therapist and supervisor, clinical evaluation of therapy, feedback and clinical rating can be performed.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Speech and Hearing Disabilities, Mumbai </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

It encompasses a rich vocabulary of hand movements, facial expressions and body postures to convey messaging. ISL facilitates communication and fosters community among deaf individuals, enabling them to express emotions, share ideas and engage in every day interactions.\nDescription: The need for audio to Indian Sign Language (ISL) conversion arrises from the communication barrier between the deaf community, which primarily uses ISL, and individuals who do not know sign language but communicate through spoken language. This barrier hinder effective communication in various settings, including education, healthcare and various interactions. Without a mean to convert audio into ISL, deaf individual faces challenging in accessing information and participating fully in society.\nExpected Solution: The expected solution entails developing technology-such as software or devices-capable of accurately converting spoken language to Indian Sign Language (ISL). This technology should use speech recognition, natural level processing, and computer vision to transcribe and interpret audio input, generating corresponding ISL gestures in real-time. It should prioritize accuracy, user-friendliness, and adaptibility to regional variation of ISL, thereby facilitating seamless communication between deaf individual and those who do not know sign language. \nFor example: 1. Development of application by which announcement/ text display in railway platform Display Unit Converted to Indian Sign Language, so that deaf people can see it and understand the announcement.\n2. Development of Mobile app through by which using Mobile Camera, normal person can understand sign language used by dead individuals.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC)\n </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                https://www.islrtc.nic.in<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/https://www.islrtc.nic.in\">https://www.islrtc.nic.in<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Not only does it lead to underutilization of resources available with various departments, execution of multiple projects at same site may also lead to interference and delays due to miscoordination. A digital platform for interdepartmental cooperation can potentially resolve these issues and make inter-departmental cooperation more streamlined.\n Example- A road developed by one agency, may get damaged due to installation of gas pipelines or utility ducts on road 2 months later. This can be resolved with preemptive collaboration between both implementing agencies.\n Description: The digital platform can provide solutions for-\n 1. Exchange of data and resources (technical expertise, machinery, technology etc.), and list of ongoing and upcoming projects between various agencies.\n 2. Scheduling of tasks, reports, and work distribution between agencies for projects categorized as \"Inter-departmental\"\n 3. Identification of projects in different departments which share the project site, and tools for assistance in organizing meetings of various departments, unified project phasing (to reduce costs incurred), planning and execution of projects.\n 4. Training and capacity building exercises, workshops &amp; seminars.\n 5. Discussion forum with (Intra department, inter department, and public form sections.\n Expected Solution- A digital platform for interdepartmental cooperation which allows functions of-\n a. Registering departments, employees, officers, technical experts etc. with their accounts.\n b. Sharing data, ongoing projects with location, and inventory of available resources between departments/agencies.\n c. Creation of tasks, scheduling, reporting and work distribution across departments for inter-departmental and multi-departmental projects.\n d.

Due to large number of projects in Indian cities, field visits by technical experts for weekly/daily monitoring becomes non-feasible. A machine learning based solution, which can identify the status of construction activities based on images, can allow the ULBs, state agencies, and central agencies to monitor physical progress daily, or even in real time.\n Description: The problem requires a machine learning based software solution in which images from sites of ongoing building construction projects can be processed, to identify the stage of construction.\n As the construction activities include multiple components, stages in construction, and interior works; the software can take inputs regarding (number of building in image, type of progress in construction activities to be assessed (foundation, super-structure, facade, interiors, etc.)), to identify the type of algorithms to be used to analyze the images.\n For different components of construction activities, different machine learning algorithms will need to be developed with training using images from construction site. If the selected category of construction activity and uploaded images have different activities/ components, the software should raise an error and ask for selection of appropriate category.\n While similar monitoring solutions are required for all types of projects, the current problem statement only includes \"building construction projects\" to keep scope of problem statement limited and assess the feasibility of similar solutions in future.\n Expected Solution: A software solution utilizing machine learning algorithm to identify stage of construction/progress of construction activities from uploaded site images. Which should be able to:\n A. Allow users to upload images and provide information regarding type of activity to be assessed (foundation, super structure, furnishing, interiors, etc.) \n B.

Retrofitting these systems with modern security protocols can he challenging and costly, particularly for organizations with limited resources or technical expertise.\nDescription: The problem statement aims to develop a universal switch set equipped with data encryption and decryption capabilities that can be seamlessly integrated into various legacy applications lacking cyber safety measures. The switch set will provide a standardized interface for encrypting sensitive data before transmission and decrypting it upon receipt, thereby enhancing the security of legacy systems.\nThe switch set will support industry-standard encryption algorithms and protocols to ensure compatibility with a wide range of legacy applications. It will be designed to be easily configurable and customizable to accommodate different encryption requirements and data formats used by various applications.\nFurthermore, the switch set will include robust key management features to securely generate. store, and distribute encryption keys to authorized users. This will prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.\nExpected Solution: The proposed solution will involve the development of a universal switch set with data encryption and decryption capabilities tailored for legacy applications without cyber safety measures. This switch set will consist of modular components, including encryption/decryption engines, key management systems, and integration interfaces. The switch set will seamlessly integrate with existing infrastructure and protocols. requiring minimal configuration and customization.\nBy retrofitting legacy applications with data encryption and decryption capabilities, the proposed solution will enable organizations to safeguard their sensitive information and comply with regulatory requirements without the need for costly system upgrades or replacements</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Smart Cities Mission </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun├ö├ç├ûs trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and SimulinkÔö¼┬½, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using SimulinkÔö¼┬½ Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.\nReferences: \n1.

SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets.

The satellite data from Indian Satellites such as Cartosat-2/3 and Cartosat-1 are capable of generating 3D city models up to LoD-1. These LoD1 models, which are derived by extruding a footprint to a uniform height, can be used for simulating building shadows. This project aims to develop an interactive application for assessing BIPV potential using LOD-1 3D city model. It will involve simulating shadow of adjoining buildings on each face of the building and estimating incident solar energy on the vertical face of the building. The application will render the building surface according to available BIPV potential.\n Challenge:\n * 3D Visualisation of LOD-1 City Model\n * Simulating Building Shadows in 3D\n * 3D Rendering of BIPV Potential on Building\n Usage: Application of Space-based inputs for Renewable Energy\n Users: The application will be deployed on VEDAS portal's '3D City Model and Rooftop Solar Potential' application. It will be usefu for Policy-makers (State &amp; Central Government), Solar Energy Solution Providers, Architects and citizens.\n Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Commercial Architectural Packages like Autodesk are suitable for building-level analysis and require substantial level of details. 3D GIS packages such as ESRI City Engine or Cesium provide visualisation capabilities. \n Software for city-wide BIPV potential estimation are currently not available in public domain.\n Desired Outcome: An interactive application where user provides a date (for calculating sun-position) and daily Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) value, and the application generates corresponding 3D city model rendered according to incident solar energy for that day. The application also provide total BIPV and rooftop PV energy potential available in the building.\n </div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Renewable / Sustainable Energy</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" https://vedas.sac.gov.in/en/sih2024.html\" target=\"_blank\"> https://vedas.sac.gov.in/en/sih2024.html</a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

These standard categories are\ndesigned to align with the Samagra Shiksha framework, which aims to ensure uniformity\nand consistency in the educational structures across the country. Schools falling outside\nthese categories, due to variations in grade configurations, are classified as having \"\"odd\nstructures.\"\"\n\nHowever, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the \"\"odd\"\" school structure category\ndue to variations in grade configurations. These odd structures pose challenges for the\nuniform implementation of educational policies and schemes, such as Samagra Shiksha. This\nmisalignment is particularly significant in states like Goa, Mizoram, West Bengal, and Kerala,\nwhere the majority of schools do not conform to the standard categories.\n\nDescription:\nThe problem of odd school structures affects the equitable distribution of resources,\neffective policy implementation, and the overall quality of education. Schools with odd\nstructures are often excluded from the streamlined processes and benefits that come with\nstandardization. The national average of schools with odd structures is 14.28%, but in some\nstates, the percentage is much higher, complicating the delivery of educational initiatives.\nThe objective is to standardize these odd school structures by aligning them with the\ndefined categories under Samagra Shiksha, thereby improving the uniformity and\neffectiveness of educational policies across the country.\n\nInnovative Solutions:\n\nA. AI-Driven School Structure Analysis Tool: Develop software that uses AI to analyze\nschool data and automatically classify schools into standard categories or identify\nthem as odd structures. This tool can also suggest optimal restructuring options to\nalign schools with the standard categories.\nB. Standardization Support Platform: Create a platform that provides guidelines, best\npractices, and resources for schools to transition from odd to standard structures.\nThe platform could include modules on infrastructure planning, grade\nreconfiguration, and community engagement strategies.\nC. Dynamic Resource Allocation System: Develop a system that allows for flexible\nresource allocation based on school structures. This system would help in\ndistributing resources more equitably by taking into account the specific needs of\nschools with odd structures during the transition period.\nD. Progress Monitoring Dashboard: Implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring\nthe progress of schools as they transition from odd to standard structures. This\ndashboard would provide insights to policymakers and administrators, allowing them\nto track changes, identify bottlenecks, and intervene as necessary.\nE. Interactive Stakeholder Engagement Portal: Develop an online portal to engage with\nschool administrators, teachers, and the community. This portal could include\nforums, feedback tools, and support resources to facilitate the transition to standard\nstructures, ensuring that the process is inclusive and addresses local concerns.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Education </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, Department of School Education &amp; Literacy (DoSEL) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

This will omit any human error during the process and also help to thoroughly reviewing the data found for the said social media account.\n * Separate options for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp, Google account etc may be provided in the tool.\n * Many a times, the social media accounts do not open in Desktops even if we have the right credentials and the examiner have to use a dummy android phone.

For hosting the services, people may utilise the paid or freely available hosting servers. Being on TOR network (V3), it is very difficult to identify the underground operator running the market. Amid running market on TOR network, the underground operator provides the access of his portal though his ISP/VPN services which has been taken from the respective ISP of his country and the VPN service provider.\nExpected Solution: It is expected that any solution like tool or technique may be developed the underground operator running the market may be identified. The participants may target finding the actual IP/VPN IP being used by the players of the onion sites. The participants may also try to find out other personally identifiable information (PII) regarding the underground operators active on the onion sites.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps ├ö├ç├┤\n1. Identification of Target Function(s) ├ö├ç├┤ Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data.\n2. Developing harness ├ö├ç├┤ Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input.\n3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis.\nDescription:\nFuzzing has proven its effectiveness in discovering thousands of vulnerabilities in file-processing and stateless applications. In fuzzing, and automated testing in general, designing test oracles is crucial. In this challenge the team is supposed to fuzz an open source software namely the Windows variant of Sumatra PDF Reader software (version 3.5.2 or later). Sumatra PDF Reader is a very popular open source and widely used PDF viewing software. In this challenge, teams are required to develop a working harness for fuzzing of the latest version (version 3.5.2 or later) of Windows Sumatra PDF Reader software solution, fuzzed on any fuzzer of their choice.\nThe submission will be evaluated on the following criteria ├ö├ç├┤\n1. Target functions identified\n2. Live demonstration of fuzzing harness developed\n3. Code Coverage achieved\n4. Technical report submitted by the team.\nExpected Solution: Each team must provide a fuzzing harness that is capable of fuzzing the windows software solution of the Sumatra PDF Reader (version 3.5.2 or later). This fuzzing harness must identify target functions and supply appropriate arguments for the invocation of such functions. The fuzzing harness will be run using a fuzzer (preferably WinAFL). Each team must submit a working harness along with a technical report stating ├ö├ç├┤\n1. Reversing steps undertaken\n2. Target functions identified\n3.

The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.\nForensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.\nDetailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.\nMoreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.\nExpected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:\n1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.\n2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats.\n3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files.\n4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports.\n5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Blockchain &amp; Cybersecurity</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Directories and Files\no Enumeration: Perform a systematic enumeration of directories and files to uncover hidden content. This involves brute-forcing directory names and file extensions to identify unlinked or forgotten resources.\no Testing: Test the discovered directories and files for common vulnerabilities such as directory traversal and insecure file uploads.\n3. Virtual Hosts (VHosts)\no Discovery: Identify virtual hosts configured on the server by fuzzing the Host header with various subdomain values.\no Assessment: Evaluate the discovered virtual hosts for configuration issues and vulnerabilities that might arise from improper isolation of web applications.\n4. API Endpoints\no Identification: Detect API endpoints by analyzing common patterns and URL structures used in the application.\no Vulnerability Testing: Test API endpoints for security flaws such as insecure data transmission, improper authentication, and authorization, as well as injection vulnerabilities.\n5. Parameters\no Fuzzing: Fuzz URL parameters to uncover vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution, and parameter pollution.\no Payloads: Use a variety of payloads and encoding techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential attack vectors.\n6. Custom Test Cases\no User-Defined Scenarios: Allow users to create and integrate custom test cases to target specific application logic or unique vulnerabilities.\no Execution: Execute custom test cases in conjunction with standard fuzzing techniques to maximize the depth and breadth of security testing.\n7. Subdomains\no Discovery: Perform DNS enumeration and brute-forcing to identify subdomains associated with the main domain.\no Security Testing: Assess the discovered subdomains for common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could expose the application to risk.\n8. Reporting\no Document Findings: Prepare detailed reports highlighting identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and potential impact. Include specific examples and explanations to aid in understanding and remediation.\no Prioritize Issues: Rank the discovered vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact to help prioritize remediation efforts.\n9. Mitigation and Remediation\no Propose Fixes: Provide actionable recommendations for addressing the identified vulnerabilities, including secure coding practices, configuration adjustments, and updates to dependencies.\no Integrate Fixes: Collaborate with the development team to implement the recommended fixes, ensuring the application is secured before deployment.\nExpected Solution:\n1. Early Detection of Vulnerabilities: Identifying security issues early in the development process, allowing for timely remediation.\n2. Improved Code Quality: Encouraging secure coding practices and reducing the likelihood of introducing security flaws.\n3. Increased Security Awareness: Raising awareness among developers about common security issues and how to avoid them.\n4. Enhanced Application Security: Reducing the risk of exploitation by addressing vulnerabilities before the application is deployed to production.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Commercial trucks of 5-14 tonnes capacity ply on these routes carrying parcels and mail. There are also state or intra-circle routes operated through a combination of commercial and departmental trucks for carrying parcels and mail. \nDescription: The RTN trucks, operating on various routes, touch intermediate points, where parcels and mail are off-loaded and loaded. The capacity utilization of the trucks fluctuates depending upon the volume of parcels/mail being carried by it [illustration: On the Ahmedabad-Ajmer-Jaipur route, Ahmedabad loads the truck up to 80% capacity for Ajmer. At Ajmer, 20 % of the volume is offloaded, and 30% loaded, bringing total loading to 90% capacity (80-20+30 = 90). Similarly, at Jaipur, 40% volume is offloaded and 50 % loaded, bringing total loading to 100% (90-40+50= 100)]. Real time data is required for optimal utilization of truck capacity and adequate planning. In order to monetize spare capacity, integration with 3PL partners for capacity sharing through API (as described in the previous point) is also required. \nRTN trucks traverse a fixed route with specific touch points. The trucks may be delayed due to various factors, such as vehicle breakdown, poor traffic conditions, detours, detention at one or more touch points etc. GPS, geofenced locking should be enabled for any detours or delays so that alerts may immediately be triggered for verification and corrective action in time. Live tracking of trucks, with points of delay is required for efficient and timely movement of parcels and mail in the value chain. \nThere should be a system for dispatch and schedule management as per live data automatically populated and analyzed in real time. Any changes or deviations should automatically flow into the system so that schedules, which are downstream, automatically get updated and adjusted to the delay in real time. \nAll data should be captured and populated automatically, and relevant MIS reports generated automatically with visualization where relevant. \nExpected Solution: As described above the expected solution is based of GPS leading to a strong GIS for the network for it to send alerts and prompt necessary adjustments on the interlinked parts of the supply chain for every run of the truck.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Communication </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Posts </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Transportation &amp; Logistics</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

This vast country wide network is managed through the Divisional Offices which are the fulcrum of all activities in post offices within their jurisdiction. With IT Modernization and digitization of processes across its network, there is a wealth of data to govern the DoP in its current context. However, adequate capacity in this direction at the Divisional level has not been developed and the oversight on the postal units in each division is a combination of inspections, visits and web-based reporting in various priority project areas taken up by the Department during the course of the year (financial inclusion drives, Ghar Ghar Tiranga, Swachhta Abhiyaan etc). As it works towards a mature digital and data driven governance model with the Division as the focal point for continuous oversight over priority parameters of network health and performance, DoP seeks a capable Data Insights and Strategic Unit (DISU) at Divisional and higher levels. This DISU, as recommended by the Government of India for all departments under the Data Governance Quality Index and related initiatives, can leverage data to improve service delivery and achieve strategic goals.\nA well-designed DISU will empower DoP to become a data-driven organization. This will lead to:\nÔö¼├Ç Improve service delivery: Optimize mail delivery routes, predict potential delays, and proactively address customer concerns.\nÔö¼├Ç Reduce operational costs: Identify areas for resource optimization and cost reduction through data-driven insights.\nÔö¼├Ç Enhance strategic decision-making: Gain data-backed insights into customer behavior and market trends to develop targeted strategies.\nBy scaling up the solution developed for one Division, DoP can establish a DISU in each of its Divisions as well as higher formations at the Regional, Circle and Headquarters level. This is a key building block of the new governance model that the DoP seeks to implement alongside its digital modernization over the years, specially in the wake of IT Modernization 2.0 project which is launched for the Branch Post Office network and would be launched in the remaining post offices during 2024-25.\nDescription: The challenge involves  designing a comprehensive hardware and software solution for establishing a scalable, future-proof DISU at the Divisional Office and higher levels. This solution should address three key areas:\nÔö¼├Ç   Data Acquisition and Integration: Develop a system to seamlessly collect data from existing DoP sources and integrate it with potential new data streams (e.g., IoT sensors, social media sentiment analysis).\nÔö¼├Ç   Data Processing and Storage: Implement a scalable and secure data processing pipeline to handle the growing volume and variety of data. Explore cloud-based storage solutions for efficient data accessibility and disaster recovery.\nÔö¼├Ç   Advanced Analytics and Insights: Develop robust analytics capabilities to extract valuable insights from the data. This includes utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for predictive maintenance, route optimization, and customer experience analysis.\nÔö¼├Ç    Data Visualization and Reporting: Design user-friendly dashboards and reports to translate complex data into actionable insights for informed decision-making at all levels within DoP.\nÔö¼├Ç  Scalability and Adaptability: The solution should be adaptable to accommodate future growth in data volume and evolving business needs of the DoP.\nÔö¼├Ç    Security and Compliance: Ensure data privacy and security through robust data governance practices and compliance with relevant regulations.\nExpected Solution: Seeking innovative proposals that leverage a combination of hardware and software solutions to build a state-of-the-art DISU. (Interested knowledge institutions can take the challenge in coordination with the Divisions convenient for each of them.)\nHardware:\nScalable servers: To handle the growing volume and complexity of data.\nSecure network infrastructure: To ensure data integrity and protection.\nSensor integration: Explore the integration of IoT sensors in key mail processing centers to gather real-time data on mail movement.\nSoftware:\nData lake platform: To store and manage diverse data sets in a raw, unprocessed format.\nData integration tools: To seamlessly connect with existing systems and external data sources.\nMachine learning and analytics libraries: For data analysis, model development, and visualization.\nBusiness intelligence (BI) platform: To create interactive dashboards and reports for informed decision-making.\nAdditional Considerations:\nPropose solutions that are cost-effective and can be implemented in a phased manner.\nAddress data security and privacy concerns to ensure the safekeeping of citizen information.\nDesign the solution for ease of use by DoP personnel with varying technical skillsets.\nThis challenge provides a unique opportunity to create a future-proof DISU that will empower DoP to become a data-driven service leader to enable the national development agenda with its all encompassing work with all stakeholders (Bazaar, Samaj and Sarkar).\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Communication </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Posts </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

PIOs still take/use Indian Products such as Puja Samagri/Traditional Attires/ Handicrafts. Most of them are dependent on e-commerce platform. Through this they cannot be assured of the quality of the products they get and transportation cost may also be very high. Secondly local sellers/small handicrafts artisans who are the actual manufacturers are not able to ship high quality products because of limited resources and information at their disposal. Hence there is a need to connect the Indian Community abroad with the local artisans.\nDescription: In order to overcome this issue an application is required through which one can go to a particular local seller as per their preference and should be able to onboard the seller as well. The following data points may be required to be integrated in the said Application.\n1.        Global Indian Diaspora Data on the basis of their needs namely ├ö├ç├┤ Income/\n Financial data, Consumption pattern and buying behavior pattern.\n2.      There should be Buyer and Seller Registration so that Quality Assurance and standard Transit Cost can be ensured.\n3.      Product and customer segments identification of target population, this includes utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) so that specific needs can be assessed like Puja Samagri of Kumartuli, Handicrafts of Santiniketan, Moya of Joynagar (famous sweets), Terracotta Arts of Bishnupur,  etc.\n4.

The Post Office also merges Pincodes together to mechanise and streamline delivery in the emerging volume and mix of mail handled at different stages, including the point of delivery. An intelligent solution, powered by AI is needed to meet the dynamic design of the supply chain both for customers as well as operators within India Post.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                            <th style=\"vertical-align: top;\">Description</th>\n                            <td>\n                                <div class=\"style-2\" style=\"overflow-y: auto; min-height:20px; max-height: 200px; width:100%;\"> Background: The Department of Post in India boasts the world's largest postal network, with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a)  to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all times.    \nDescription: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item must clearly indicate the recipient's Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code. However, inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in the system. \nExpected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Communication </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Posts </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Transportation &amp; Logistics</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

However, each socio-geographic formation at the state, district, block and village level has its own demographic realities that require a customised thrust for making the relevant financial and insurance services available to the served population around each post office.  For example,  in West Bengal, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher where if Melas for Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts ( SSA) and Mahila Samriddhi Samman Patras (MSSC) can be arranged, the effectiveness of the sales effort and the conversion rate will be higher. Similarly, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher and higher  number of Senior Citizen Social Security (SCSS) accounts can be opened for their benefit to justify presence of post offices in these areas. But there is no such report from where it can be identified, where and when the need of which product is higher. All melas like SSA, MSSC, Postal Life Insurance (PLI) , Rural Postal Life Insurance ( RPLI)  have been arranged in villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child and senior citizens resulting in moderate to mediocre success for the efforts.  \nDescription: The Department of Posts has implemented various POSB Schemes in All over India uniformly. Actual demographic location-wise population is to be identified. In West Bengal, for example, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher. In some sectors demand young generation and service holders are much higher. The need of the youth and service holders are very different from the demands of other sector of people. Density of farmers and business-oriented people are higher in some areas.  All melas like SSA, MSSC, Public Provident Fund (PPF), Recurring Deposits (RD), Time Deposit ( TD)  PLI, RPLI have been arranged in every city and villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child/senior citizens and other sectors of people and as a result the success of all the melas are found not satisfactory. \nExpected Solution: The expected solution is pictorial data and actual demographic and economic location-wise population is to be identified.  The demographic and location-wise population data is to be taken as a fundamental data towards improvement of financial (banking &amp; insurance) services.\n</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Communication </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Posts </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

E-commerce organisations like Amazon,Flipkart, financial organisations like ICICI, HDFC etc are providing door step products/services with use of advanced technology like digital platform or machine learning through AI. This creates another level of acceptance across the world among the recipient for the organisation. This is becoming part of basic customer expectation and needs to be included in the Department├ö├ç├ûs common value proposition with the help of a robust system tied to its operational system. \nDescription: India Post as the largest mail delivery organisation in India delivers articles/parcels at the door step of customer. The delivery is one of the key services the Department offers to the citizens of India. Department reaches last mile of delivery through its branches. The delivery process initiates at the booking Post office after receiving mails/articles. After sorting, the concerned Postman of the delivery Post Office has to reach to the recipient for delivering article mostly during the office hours, i.e. in between 10am to 5pm. In many instances, recipient cannot receive the article within that time range of the delivery due to his absence at the delivery address. In that case i) Post man either has to make 2nd attempt or next day delivery which falls within same time range orii) after unsuccessful delivery Postman has to serve intimation for next day delivery or for window delivery at Post Office by the recipient personally. In both cases, wastage of valuable working hours of the Postman happens for sure. Moreover, due to such incident, recipient has to take leave from his/her work as delivery time range/slot gets coincided with his/her working hours for collecting the article. In many cases article gets returned to sender because of non-availability of the addressee within time range of Postman delivery.\nThis creates dissatisfaction on the delivery service among both Sender and Receiver of the article/consignment, thus lowering departmental performance index. Hence Department is losing the extra mile of delivery performance in the eye of customer of modern era as well as e-commerce like product oriented organizations who uses last mile unique delivery system of this organisation.\nExpected Solution: -\nAt time of booking of any consignment sender should have option to select time slot for delivery and share the same with the recipient which can be modified by the sender online at any point of time before the date of delivery.\nWhenever recipient will receive sms/alert about the consignment to be delivered at his/her end with the mentioned time slot, the recipient should have the option/flexibility to make change of time slot online before the day of delivery.\nInitially such data will create training data for AI which will develop a reference frame of time slot for sender and also for delivery person of department for timely and customer friendly future delivery of article for same recipient.\nLast mile of delivery information will become integral part of booking which will help both consignment movement across the country and effective delivery. </div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Communication </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Posts </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Transportation &amp; Logistics</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Currently, each postal circle releases its own material, catering primarily to philatelists within its respective jurisdiction and immediate reach. Consequently, philatelists from other circles often find it challenging to obtain such material. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness regarding ancillary releases among the philatelic community nationwide.\nDescription:\nTo address these issues, the development of a comprehensive website dedicated to philately, which would serve as a centralized platform for philatelists across India is the prospective solution suggested.  This website would facilitate the creation of a National Philately Deposit Account, enabling philatelists to access philatelic material released pan India. Other supporting mechanisms to strengthen the community can also be thought of and integrated to the main solution. \nExpected Solution:\nThe proposed website would offer the following features:\nCentralized Platform: The website would display philatelic material released by all postal circles across India, ensuring that philatelists have access to a wide range of items.\nOnline Ordering and Payment: Philatelists would be able to order and pay for philatelic material online through the website, streamlining the purchasing process and eliminating geographical barriers.\nStandard Postal Services: Postage for ordered items would be charged at the standard rates for Registered/ Speedpost services, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery.\n Cancellation Releases: Information regarding cancellation releases would be made available on the website, allowing philatelists to obtain cancellations on postal stationery through the website.

This lack of awareness often leads to inefficient application, reduced crop yield, and potential environmental issues due to over or under-application. Accurately measuring the nutrient content of F/L OM is essential for optimizing its use and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices. However, existing solutions are often expensive and complex, making them inaccessible to small farmers.\n \n Expected Solution: The development of low-cost, easy-to-use kits that can accurately measure the nutrient content of F/L OM. These kits should be affordable for small farmers and provide reliable data on the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other essential nutrients. This will enable farmers to make informed decisions about the application of F/L OM, thereby improving soil health, crop yield, and overall sustainability.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

However, the nutrient content of F/L OM can vary widely, often being insufficient to meet the needs of various crops. Enrichment of F/L OM with additional nutrients or through enhanced fermentation processes can significantly improve its efficacy as an organic fertilizer. Despite this potential, current enrichment methods are often too costly or complex for small farmers to implement, limiting their ability to fully benefit from F/L OM.\n \n Expected Solution: The creation of low-cost, scalable enrichment models for F/L OM that can be easily adopted by small farmers. These models should focus on enhancing the nutrient content of F/L OM through affordable additives or optimized fermentation techniques. The goal is to produce a more potent and consistent organic fertilizer that can boost crop yields while remaining accessible and practical for village-level production.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Jal Shakti </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Clean &amp; Green Technology</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Bacteriological contamination, particularly by pathogens such as E. coli and Total coliform, presents significant health hazards, especially in rural areas. Traditional methods of testing for bacteriological contamination are often inaccessible, costly, or require specialized knowledge, making them unsuitable for widespread use in rural communities. The goal of this challenge is to develop a personalized testing kit specifically designed to detect bacteriological contamination in drinking water. This kit should be user-friendly, affordable, and capable of providing accurate results comparable to those obtained through laboratory analysis. The ultimate aim is to empower rural households to independently monitor the bacteriological safety of their drinking water, enabling timely intervention to prevent waterborne diseases.\n \n Expected Solutions:\n i. The device should be portable and sensitive enough to detect even low levels of bacteriological contamination (E. coli &amp; Total coliform) as per BIS 10500: 2012, which mandates that these pathogens should not be detectable in any 100 ml of sample.\n ii. The detected value should clearly indicate the level of bacterial contamination in a 100 ml water sample, with results displayed in a digital format.\n iii. The testing kit should be affordable, easy to carry, and user-friendly, requiring minimal training for operation by individuals in rural settings.\n iv. It should be durable and capable of functioning effectively in the challenging environmental conditions typical of rural India, including extreme temperatures and humidity.\n v. The kit should provide quick results, allowing households to promptly assess the safety of their drinking water.\n vi. Calibration of the testing kit should be straightforward, ensuring consistent accuracy over time.\n vii. The kit should have low operation and maintenance costs, making it sustainable for long-term use.\n viii. The testing kit must comply with relevant regulatory standards for water quality testing in India.\n ix. It should be powered by lithium or another type of battery, with a minimum operational time of 24 hours after a full charge.\n x.

National Security Guard (NSG) is a Federal Contingency Force, which operates within a Close Quarters Battle (CQB) environment in an urban warfare scenario. NSG operates on modus operandi of Small Team Operations, with the House Intervention Team (HIT) being the smallest combat unit. \n 2. In any CQB scenario, the NSG Task Force operates down to a HIT level with the Task Force Commander situated at the Integrated Command Post (ICP), with an aim to get real time location of the soldiers and a better tactical picture of the ongoing operations. The HITs mostly operate in built up areas (for example in Hotels, Hospitals, Metro stations, Buildings of National importance, etc) consisting of multiple floors and basements. Every soldier operates with the advanced military gear and radio communication utilized for conveying operational decisions. In such a setup, knowing the exact location of the soldier down to the floor/ basement is of paramount importance. \n 3. Traditional GPS/ GSM based solutions give the location on a 2D scale with no information regarding the floor at which the soldier is operating. Getting down to the floor level requires the installation of hardware on the floor for tracking the soldiers with the help of RFID or utilization of altimeter, accelerometer carried by the soldier. \n 4. Live location tracking in urban built up areas for CQB operations, addressing the following problems. \n (a) Location Tracking of HITs. Live tracking of HITs so that the Commander is able to track HITs operating on multiple floors/ basements. This helps in efficient command and control and thus enabling early success in the operations. \n (b) 3D Model. NSG keeps a database of 3D models of buildings which are potential targets for terror attacks. The 3D models of the buildings exist in the industry standard format. It is required that the resultant live location of the HITs (obtained through these trackers) be displayed on the pre-existing 3D models of the buildings.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Security Guard (NSG), MHA </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Security Guard (NSG) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

National Security Guard (NSG) operates inside buildings, built up areas and other infrastructures like metro stations, schools, etc in case of any terror. Since the operations are of National security significance, better understanding of the target layout is of paramount importance. 3-Dimensional walk through of the buildings helps in the efficient understanding of the target layout and also enables effective briefing of the troops by the Commander for operating inside such targets. \n 2. Presently, the building authorities provide 2-Dimensional layout of the building in the form of blue prints/ floor plan. Assimilation of the situation and appreciating the potent threat with the help of 2-Dimensional layout turns out to be a challenging task. In such a scenario, a 3-Dimensional walk-through of the building helps significantly in increasing the efficiency of the ground forces while operating. \n 3. The software which needs to be developed should take the 2-Dimensional blueprint layout as input and also should take various parameters like length, breadth, height of the building, layout of staircase, entry and exit, etc as additional inputs. The software should then export them to a file and create a full fledged 3-Dimensional walkthrough model of the building. The software must also include the facility for integration of exported model to the offline Google maps, Satellite pictures (if any available). \n 4. Since the target includes buildings which are secretive in nature, the software is required to be operable fully in standalone mode, without any internet connectivity required in future. For the initial installation phase, the system can be connected to the internet to facilitate fetching up of Maps, satellite imagery from open source, etc required for the software functioning. \n 5. This software would also reduce the time taken during the initial briefing of the troops prior to the launch of any operation. It further increases the efficiency of the operations, thus resulting in early success. \n 6. The conversion of 2-Dimensional blueprints to 3-Dimensional models must address following problems. \n (a) Software should take 2-Dimensional blueprint as an input and produce 3- Dimensional walk through as output. \n (b) Provisions to input parameters like length, breadth, height of the building and other details should be included. \n (c) Minimum supervision from the user end should be needed to finalise the conversion. \n (d) Offline integration with Google maps, satellite imagery to get enhanced output covering the nearby geographical areas as well.</div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>National Security Guard (NSG), MHA </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>National Security Guard (NSG) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Smart Automation</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

Prevailing sub zero temperature in deployment area coupled with low atmospheric pressure &amp; high wind speed drastically reduces output of human as well as electronic equipment as compared to plains/semi plains areas. Further deployment of ITBP is valley based which is connected through main land by narrow road/track which remain cutoff due to prolonged winter/monsoon season. Thus unique &amp; harsh climatic condition coupled with poor road connectivity in remote mountainous area make it quite impossible to deploy cutting edge equipment which are readily available in the Indian market. \n In such conditions, logistic sustenance including supply of essential medicine &amp; fresh ration becomes difficult, time consuming and risky, which ultimately affects morale of deployed force personnel and their operational efficiency. Logistic Drone can be useful in the delivery of life saving medicines, essential equipments, fresh ration, small arms and ammunition, important manuals and documents etc. \n Description: \n The above Problem Statement envisages, that Logistic Drone be developed to transport 35-40 Kg logistic supplies such as life saving medicines, medical equipments, water, fresh fruits and vegetables and other critical resources to ITBP troops deployed at remote forward area. Logistic Drone with payload capacity of 40 Kg can significantly reduce delivery time and cost in area having poor road infrastructure or which remain cut-off during prolonged winter and monsoon season. \n Expected solution: \n A Logistic Drone capable to transport 35-40 Kg payload at high altitude area (9000 ft- 16000 ft) and stable against high wind speed (40-70 Km/Hr.). The flying endurance should be more than 75 minutes and mission range should be more than 20 Kms (one side) with total endurance to fly minimum 40 Km without change of battery, the Logistic Drone can be powered by battery, fuel, solar/combination of any two of these. Operating altitude should be up to 1500 mtr (AGL) at high altitude area. The operating temperature range should be -35 degree C to 55 degree C. The area required for taken off/landing should not be more than 15 mtr x 15 mtr. \n </div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), MHA </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Hardware</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Robotics and Drones</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                <br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/\"><br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",

When a user submits a new title for verification, we need to check its similarity against the existing titles in our database. The goal is to ensure that the new title does not duplicate or closely resemble any existing title to avoid confusion and maintain uniqueness. Additionally, the system must enforce specific guidelines to ensure that certain words are not used, combinations of existing titles are not allowed, and titles with similar meanings or periodicity modifications are rejected.\n Problem Description\n Develop a system to automatically verify new title submissions by checking for similarities with existing titles in the database and ensuring compliance with specific guidelines. The system should reject titles that are too similar to existing ones, contain disallowed words, or violate other outlined rules. Additionally, the system should provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified.\n Requirements:\n 1.        Similarity Check:\n a.        Implement a mechanism to check for similar-sounding names using phonetic similarity algorithms (e.g., Soundex, Metaphone).\n b.        Identify titles that have common prefixes or suffixes (e.g., The, India, Samachar, News).\n c.        Ensure that variations in spelling or slight modifications do not bypass the similarity check (e.g., Namaskar vs. Namascar).\n d.        Calculate a similarity percentage for each title comparison.\n \n 2.        Prefix/Suffix Handling:\n a.        Maintain a list of disallowed prefixes and suffixes.\n b.        Reject any new titles that include these disallowed prefixes or suffixes if they cause the new title to resemble an existing title closely.\n 3.        Guideline Enforcement:\n a.        Maintain a list of disallowed words (e.g., Police, Crime, Corruption, CBI, CID, Army).\n b.        Ensure that titles containing these disallowed words are rejected.\n c.        Prevent the creation of new titles by combining existing ones (e.g., if \"Hindu\" and \"Indian Express\" exist, \"Hindu Indian Express is not allowed\"). \n d.        Check for titles with similar meanings in other languages and reject them (e.g., \"Daily Evening\" and \"Pratidin Sandhya\").\n e.        Disallow adding periodicity (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to existing titles to form new ones.\n 4.        Verification Probability:\n a.        Provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified.\n 5.        Database Interaction:\n a.        Efficiently search and compare new titles against the database of 160,000 titles.\n b.        Track current applications and use them for future reference to reject similar titles submitted later.\n c.        Use indexing and optimised search techniques to handle the large dataset and ensure quick responses.\n 6.        User Feedback:\n a.        Provide clear feedback to the user if their submitted title is too similar to an existing title, contains disallowed prefixes/suffixes, violates guidelines, or is created by combining existing titles.\n b.        Display the verification probability to the user.\n c.        Allow the user to modify their title and resubmit it for verification.\n 7.        Scalability:\n a.        Design the system to handle an increasing number of titles and user submissions.\n b.        Ensure that the system remains performant as the database grows.\n Expected Solution:\n 1.        The system will provide the probability of a title being verified. For instance, if a title has a similarity score of 80%, the verification probability shall not be more than 100%-80%=20%\n 2.        The system will reject any new title that is too similar to existing ones, contains disallowed words or prefixes/suffixes, combines existing titles, or has similar meanings in other languages.\n 3.        The system will track current applications and use them for future reference, rejecting similar titles submitted later by other users.\n Acceptance Criteria:\n 1.        Accuracy:\n a.        The system correctly identifies similar-sounding titles and provides consistent results.\n b.        The system accurately rejects titles with disallowed prefixes, suffixes, and words.\n c.        The system prevents the creation of titles by combining existing titles and identifies titles with similar meanings in other languages.\n d.        The system disallows adding periodicity to existing titles.\n e.        The system provides an accurate verification probability score.\n 2.        Performance:\n a.        Title verification is completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 2 seconds per title).\n b.        The system can handle multiple title verification requests simultaneously without significant performance degradation.\n 3        User Experience:\n a.        Users receive clear and actionable feedback on why their title was rejected.\n b.        Users see a probability score indicating the likelihood of their title being verified.\n c.        The interface for title submission and feedback is user-friendly and intuitive.\n 4        Robustness:\n a.        The system handles edge cases and variations in spelling effectively.\n b.        The system is resilient to errors and provides meaningful error messages when issues occur.\n </div>\n                               </td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Organization</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Information and Broadcasting </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n                            \n                            <tr>\n                                <th>Department</th>\n                            <td>Ministry of Information and Broadcasting </td>\n                                            \n                            </tr>  \n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Category</th>\n                            <td>Software</td>\n                            </tr>\n\n                            <tr>\n                            <th>Theme</th>\n                            <td>Miscellaneous</td>\n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Youtube Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n                                                      <tr>\n                              <th>Dataset Link</th>\n                              <td>\n                                https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13p8Z_XU9oJjzHiiJI8HSGBgFQFCOC76E?usp=sharing<br>\n                                 <!-- <a href=\"https://www.sih.gov.in/uploads/psData/https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13p8Z_XU9oJjzHiiJI8HSGBgFQFCOC76E?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13p8Z_XU9oJjzHiiJI8HSGBgFQFCOC76E?usp=sharing<br></a> -->\n                                                                                          </td>  \n                            </tr>\n                            <tr>\n                              <th>Contact info</th>\n                              <td>\n                                    <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\"> </a>\n                            </td>  \n                            </tr> \n    \n                      </thead>\n                     </table>",
