# SIH 2025 Problem Statement Explorer

This project is a static web application that scrapes, stores, and interactively displays problem statements from the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** website. It uses a Puppeteer scraper to generate a JavaScript dataset and a pure vanilla JS frontend for easy exploration.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://diekaiju.github.io/scapper-with-ui/](https://siddiq2772.github.io/scapper-with-ui/)

## 🚀 Features

-   **Automated Scraper**: Extracts detailed data including Problem ID, Organization, Category, Theme, Submission Count, Deadline, and Descriptions.
-   **Static Architecture**: Data is stored in `data.js` as a global JavaScript object, allowing the app to run directly from local file paths without CORS issues.
-   **Modern UI**: A responsive Single Page Application (SPA) with glassmorphism design and smooth animations.
-   **Hierarchical Navigation**: Browse by **Category -> Theme -> Organization -> Problem Statement**.
-   **Instant Filtering**: Client-side filtering ensures immediate feedback without server round-trips.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Scraping**: Node.js, Puppeteer
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS, JavaScript
-   **Data Storage**: JavaScript Object (Global Variable)
